My baby would only sleep in my arms due to severe reflux so I decided to put in some headphones and watch a ""random"" show I had heard a friend mention.

That show was Doctor Who(2005). The Doctor became my companion that day during one of the most lonely periods of my life. Now, safely on the other side of depression, Doctor Who still brings me so much comfort.

This has been happening for years, no matter who the person is. It‚Äôs not necessarily about them but more about how I feel in general when it comes to relationships.

I lost my father when I was 13 and was raised by my mother (I am a single child). My uncle, aunt supported my education. I tried to date but broke up every single time.

I can't feel anything I felt yesterday for him, anywhere in my body today. It's like it's gone completely like it never was there.

I‚Äôm a software engineer, and I work out almost every day, try to eat healthy and stay fit, and do things I enjoy. I really thought I had healed. But today I found I was not.

I'm a 20 year old guy. I want to be a good guy who's an ally to women but I'm constantly worried about making women uncomfortable.  
I'm worried I'm looking at women funny. I know I objectify women and I hate myself for it. I asked for advice on another sub and I was told that I fear being a creep because I am a creep, and that I need to leave women alone. I want to not make women uncomfortable but I also don't wanna have to spend life alone. I also see stuff about how male feminists are wolves in sheep's clothing and it makes me worried I'll be found out as one of the bad guys. 

I know women have it harder. I know my issues are nothing compared to theirs and understandably their issues are more important.

I‚Äôve seen people on the internet describe it as more occasional, but I‚Äòve been having it 24/7, I stop disassocating on completely random moments without an actual pattern, I just know that I‚Äòm more vulnerable to disassociating whenever I think too hard about something like school work or socializing. On top of that I also have some crazy anxiety issues, as my heart is beating fast almost all the time (or it‚Äôs something completely unrelated). It has ruined my life completely and I have had suicidal thought on moments that I have serious panic attacks on. 

Only since August of last year have I started to understand what derealization and disassociation is, which made me feel better from sympathizing with it, but it only slightly improved my condition since then. I am confused, 2 months ago, I have read that the best way to treat it is by doing things like hobbies and being engaged even though I‚Äôm disassociating or think I might disassociate, but nothing can really snap me out of whenever I‚Äôm disassociating, it just passes eventually, although pushing myself to be engaged even though I‚Äôm afraid I might disassociate has worked. 

Nobody in my family knows about my condition, I don‚Äôt seek a therapist because I‚Äôm too scared to tell my family and second I don‚Äôt even know where I can find one that doesn‚Äôt cost money. My parents control all my purchases, so I can‚Äôt do it myself. Another reason is because I‚Äôm disassociating most of the time and I don‚Äôt have the power to try to find professional help.

Overall I don‚Äôt really see much assurance in what I‚Äôm doing, I know it‚Äôs slow and takes many months to recover but it has been 2 months since I started pushing myself and kept being active and I‚Äôm close to graduating high school.

1jbpmsv,feeling pretty hopeless after recent doctors appointment,mentalhealth,1742022885.0,4,2,"i, 20f, have been struggling with major depressive disorder, anxiety, and OCD since i was about 13. i started sertraline when i was 14 and am currently on 50mg

ever since i was 16, i have developed some kind of sleep disorder, a mix between insomnia and hypersomnia. i can sleep for 30 hours +, and then have times where i can‚Äôt sleep for three nights straight.

my doctor knows about this and has prescribed me amitriptyline to help me get to sleep, which works great, but when i‚Äôm in a really bad fatigue stage, genuinely nothing can help. i cant get a job because of this, meaning i have no source of income. my parents are officially my caregivers and are given a small payment fro the government to look after me, but that‚Äôs it.

at my recent appointment, i went over these issues with her again. she said that medication is only half of the treatment, which is why i‚Äôm not getting better, and i really need psychotherapy, mainly CBT. she says that my sleep issues are very likely connected to my mental health issues

i completely see where she‚Äôs coming from and i don‚Äôt doubt her. this appointment has just left me so hopeless now. i cannot afford therapy. like at all. i was able to get free therapy when i was 16 and under but no cannot because i‚Äôm no longer a minor. like i said earlier, i cannot get a job because of these issues, and my parents are only being paid a very small amount, it only covers my medication and some food.

therapy appointments here start at $100 an hour and there‚Äôs no way i can afford that, it took us a month just to be able to afford a regular GP appointment. i‚Äôm at a dead end, i fear there‚Äôs nothing more i can do and that scares me. i‚Äôve been doing these stupid online surveys and stuff to try and earn some cash but it‚Äôs only pocket change.

i feel stupid because i know there‚Äôs people out there that have it so much worse than me, it just sucks. my parents feel so guilty they can‚Äôt help more, and i always tell them it‚Äôs not their fault. i‚Äôm so sorry for everyone else in a similar position too.

1iti4pu,My Situation is Begining to feel Hopeless,mentalhealth,1740002899.0,7,2,"For a bit of context I (20 F) posted this anonymously on my local Facebook page and on some other Reddit pages. But I wanted to post it here too because this is so much more than a financial issue. I have been struggling with my mental health through all of this and need a different perspective. 

""I am so embarrassed to make this post but I would just really appreciate some advice. I am a full time student working as much as I can. However, due to medical issues I have been dealing with the best I am physically able to do is about 9 hours a week while still failing all my classes. I am trying so hard to get my life together but I just feel like I am at an all time low. I working with doctors and my therapist to try and get back to working more but it is taking so much longer than I hoped. And I have basically run out of money. 

Today I wanted to go to the store to get a few things to make a cake. It is the 4 year anniversary of my dad's passing. Last year I had some amazing people in my life that helped me make this day better and represent something else for me. And we made a cake last year. So I was planning to make that day something to be remembered instead. But, I just checked my bank account to see how much I had to spare on a few ingredients but I have nothing. I have 1 third of next months rent and that is it. I am honestly devastated, and feeling ashamed. 

I would work more if I could but I can't. I am in too much pain and constantly sick. Luckily my last test results gave some answers so now I'm just waiting for a different consultation before trying some new medications. I have put some of my clothes up for sale online but no buyers yet. I have promoted my art and have tried to sell my paintings but again no luck. I have been looking for weeks for higher paying jobs but I just can't find anything that I would be able to manage with my health and trying to finish this semester.

I'm really not trying to throw a pitty party. I am just so disappointed in myself for not preparing better incase of unseen circumstances like this. I would love any advice to try and get out of this rutt. I'm going to try and sell some more clothes around town and try and sell more things online but I'm not sure I'm going to be able to pay my rent without getting in debt. 

If there is anything I can do within my physical capability I will do it. I can make good pies and cupcakes if anyone thinks people would be interested in that. I can edit photos decently and have a little bit of experience in graphic design. I don't know what to do with all of this though.

I was adopted by a family that didn‚Äôt understand the trauma I had experienced. When I was seven, I went through an earthquake, and it was really hard for me to process everything. I would lash out because I didn‚Äôt know how to handle my emotions, and instead of recognizing that I needed help‚Äîor even just a hug‚Äîmy parents labeled me as the ‚Äúproblem child.‚Äù

All my life, I was raised to be the scapegoat. My mom, who was my biggest bully, turned everyone against me, including my siblings. I felt like I had nowhere to turn. I was kicked out at 17, and it‚Äôs been really hard ever since.

1jfg6hf,My friend is hopelessly depressed and only has me to rely on. I feel like he's not trying and I can't handle it anymore. What do I do?,mentalhealth,1742442340.0,2,1,"I *really* need help and advice here. I know this is quite long, so if you read it, thankyou so much.

I (29F) love my friend (29M) but I can't handle his hopelessness anymore, and I'm starting to feel really resentful towards him (which makes me feel horribly guilty). We've been friends for 9 years, throughout which he has struggled with depression and trauma. I have too, deeply, so I get it, and through hard work I have healed a lot. I've always been there to support him, but over the last year he has cut off almost all his friends, and now solely relies on me for social connection and support. I'm the only person he trusts and talks to honestly, and he felt like none of his other friends really understood him, which he was very resentful about. I can't help thinking, of course they didn't understand him, because he didn't open up to them, and this is a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy of isolation. 

  
He is very, very set in the belief that happiness and connection are impossible for him, and that he shouldn't have to try or hope for a happy life. About a year ago, we were living together, and I felt like I was the only thing that made him happy and that he was codependently relying on me to be his life buoy. We argued, and I told him he needed to prioritise his own happiness in order to heal. He replied that not caring about his own happiness is fundamental to who he is, and issued an ultimatum: if I wanted to be his friend, I had to accept that about him. I didn't want to stop being friends - I really care about him, and honestly, I was worried about how he would cope without me - but after a year of accepting these terms, I feel completely exhausted, hopeless, burdened and (recently) really angry with him. 

I don't live with him anymore but I am still the only person he is really friends with. He lives alone and is making no effort to make friends or go to therapy. He finds logical reasons to justify these things, but I can't help but think he just doesn't want to face the fear, shame, vulnerability and possible rejection/failure that may come with trying to build himself a good life/community and working on himself and his unresolved trauma.

  
I've been trying to set boundaries with him, only giving what I can give etc, but last week I reached my breaking point. He told me that he will never be able to be happy and that connection is simply not possible for him - as if depression and isolation are his identity. Later he asked to move in with me, because it would be good for *his* mental health, assuming I'd say yes and without even considering how I would feel. Suddenly, I was completely furious. I feel like he feels so entitled to codependently rely on me, and thinks that as long as he has me he can cope with the rest of his life being incredibly hopeless and miserable. He doesn't seem to consider or care about the impact this has on me, though I have told him before how stressed and grieved I am over his refusal to seek help. I can't stop being angry, and at this point what I actually want is not to see him anymore. I feel like his reliance on me is holding him back and frankly I'm just sick of it. I feel like he is being selfish in asking me to stick around and watch him rot in misery forever. However, I'm genuinely worried about what will happen if I am honest with him and say I need a break, which would leave him entirely alone. What do I do? ",hopeless

Okay, maybe I‚Äôve been struggling for a few years now but 27 feels like that part in a movie that the entirety of it has lead up to and now you‚Äôre at the edge of your seat in anticipation. That‚Äôs how I feel at least. From the outside, I probably seem to have it all figured out. I have a good paying job, I‚Äôm happy with my career choice, I just got engaged, I have good friends. And yet, I still find happiness eluding me. I‚Äôve never been one to put a lot of stock in how the material world perceives me or how people perceive me in general. I‚Äôm okay with who I am. I‚Äôm confident in this skin but I still can‚Äôt shake this feeling of uncertainty. It‚Äôs gotten way worse since my birthday. Most days I wake up with a dark cloud over me and I go to bed with it still there. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, some days the dark cloud lets a little sunshine through but that‚Äôs just it, it‚Äôs still there. I never get the full scope of the sun shining on my skin. It‚Äôs always overcast. If we‚Äôre being honest, it‚Äôs starting to lead me towards thoughts of suicide. Not that I‚Äôm seriously considering it or that I haven‚Äôt struggled with these thoughts in the past but this feels different. Under normal circumstances, something inconvenient will happen in my life (i.e. death of a close one) and I‚Äôll get very sad and then it gets better. You know, the normal stuff. This year though, unlike anything I‚Äôve really experienced before. It‚Äôs like all these good things are happening to me and yet, I still feel shitty inside.

There‚Äôs people suffering everywhere and here I am throwing myself a pity party over god knows what. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense but here I am. I find myself waking up every morning and throwing a costume on because it‚Äôs easier to pretend than to explain this awful feeling. Again, I‚Äôm not here to talk about how I hate my life or how I want to die. It‚Äôs just very foreign to me to have things going my way and still feel bummed inside. Is it always this hard? Does it get better? I just don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep up the facade before I have to explain this thing I‚Äôm feeling. I‚Äôve tried talking to my fianc√©e about this but I just get the run of the mill advice you can slap on most instances.

I've been feeling incredibly depressed lately, I'm poor, despite working 30+ hours a week at a job I enjoy and also live with a partner who works part-time. My (large, about 20-30 cousins) family always seems more successful. They all own homes, have kids (though I don't want that) deapite working similar hours to me. I know my parents or siblings would help me financially if I asked, but it would be 100% transactional. I'd be expected to pay it back and then some.

I'm also largely friendless. I do have some friends, but only one I'm actually close with. The rest are kind of just people I know. More aquaintances than friends.

My partner is loving and supportive of me, but is also struggling with their own mental health concerns. 

I just feel so alone.

1jnvut3,Overwhelming emotion. I'm new. I don't need this to explode.,mentalhealth,1743398060.0,4,1,"I have an increasingly serious... THING that's been developing since my early 20's. I hear or see things and they fill me with the emotion I believe they were intending, but it's too much.
LORE: I'm a 27yo M. I've been diagnosed with OCD, but with a caveat I don't remember or know if relevant. Im afraid to go see a doctor and i dont know why. Ive taken autism tests and have come back ""definitely on the spectrum"" despite me not ""feeling"" ""un-normal"" (I'm not trying to degrade mental illness and say it's 'lesser than'. I'm just scared and trying to put it in as plain of English as I can)
SCENARIO: Things have been affecting me too much more, by my standards, recently. For this I'll give a couple examples. I'm a fan of Sleater-Kinney, and a few days ago I listened to their song ""Little babies"" again for the first time in couple years. It sent me on an existential crisis of second wave feminism and the controversial and dichotomy ""role of 'the mother'"" I was constantly on the verge of tears and I don't know why. I cry, I feel, often enough, but some many things are pushing me towards that extreme of emotion regularly. The  other example is; I delivered something to a Walmart that was an employee appreciation BBQ out back near the delivery area. They had a company doing it and a bunch of Walmart employees were out there, getting their food. I asked an older ladies (maybe in her late 50's, early 60's) what was going on and they said ""it's because our accident calendar went past 100 days."" That's nothing! I should have just said ""Cool!"" Which I did. But I was overcome with a sense of dread. The same feeling I got after my 2nd and last trip of any hallucinogenic, where I'm sad and way to overly empathetic for this older person that I don't know, or know her circumstance, but I'm scribing a ""wasted life"" onto her for no reason, and it fills me with so much emotion that I need to disassociate, lest risk a panic attack. 
Am I just an asshole? Is this just was ""normal"" people go through and I'm just realizing it for the first time. It's ok if it is, I'm always trying to be a better person, but I'm so confused and scared.

Thanks to any person that replies to this. Know that it's only a little crisis and your word won't completely dictate my future actions. I'm not unstable, just very curious after a ""not so fun"" episode.",overwhelmed

I'm writing this while at work, trying to keep it together, but I feel like I'm falling apart inside.

Last night, I saw a picture of my girlfriend at a nightclub. She looked so happy hugging a friend, big smile, surrounded by people, clearly having a great time. I *should* be happy because I love her and want her to have the best life. But for some reason, that image hit me like a truck. I felt a pain in my chest, a deep loneliness, like everything inside me collapsed. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I felt like crying, but the tears wouldn‚Äôt come. Underneath it all, there was this heavy pressure, like rage or helpless frustration.

I don‚Äôt know if this was an anxiety attack I‚Äôve never really had one before but it felt intense and overwhelming in a way I‚Äôve never experienced. Like my body and mind were completely hijacked.

I haven‚Äôt told her about this. I know she has every right to go out and have fun  I‚Äôm not trying to control her. But it triggered something in me that I can‚Äôt fully explain. It‚Äôs not jealousy in the usual sense. It‚Äôs more like‚Ä¶ I feel left behind. Like she‚Äôs glowing, and I‚Äôm fading.

Recently my gf found out she has bipolar II and that it's what's causing her to auditory hallucinations. For the most part she's able to keep the voice to the back of her mind during the day, but at night, night is when it can get down right scary for her. 95% of the time the voices take on the sound of the parents. The voices could sound muffled like it's happening from the other room, other times the voices are moving in all directions circling her like pray, and in bad times they are screaming (the volume amplifies when she tries to ignore them with head phones.). 

Most nights she's in the fetal position shaking even if and when she does fall asleep her body will still be shaking. I'm seeing this all unfold before me every day and every night, there's nothing worse then seeing the person u love most going through such agony that she wishes for death, and m knowing there's nothing I can do to take it way. I do the best I can I really do. I'm trying to learn what I can about bipolar, I listen to her, reasure her that what she is hearing isn't happening, I hold her till she stops crying, I try to make her smile, keep her distracted, I wake up at the drop of the hate if she needs anything, when I can tell she's having nightmares I kiss her and whisper it's okay I'm here. I don't sleep that well anymore cause I'm waking up cause I hear her crying or she wakes me up cause she's scared.

 Majority of the time she doesn't want me to sleep she feels better hearing that I'm awake playing fortnite lol. Luckily I'm not going about this all alone, her wonderful cat Cheeto a literal angel and one of the best souls on this planet has been helping me and sometimes it's a tag team effort. When I'm not home for whatever reason he handles her very well sometimes with better success than me at times. When she's dissociating and just completely gone from her body he will walk up to her reach out and tap her on the shoulder, press his head into her arm. When she's in bed he will lay on her chest and apply pressure, if she's hitting herself he's comes and gets her to pet him instead. 

He was never taught this behavior but just new instinctually that she needed him. Sometimes when it's at its worst I'm holding her and cheetoes rubbing up on her and/or sitting on her she will eventually feel safe and calm down. I seriously fear the day he dies, It will completely destroy her and I feel I might lose her. She's seeing Drs but she's trying to find others cause they are not a good fit, the medication she's been trying isn't working they don't listen or try other medication. She often says she feels she running out of time and I'm just fucking scared for her, I just want her happy and to have whatever normalcy she can possibly have.

It is almost Christmas and the feelings of worthlessness are creeping back again. For some background, I graduated from high school in 2023. At the time I was 18 and not much different from today. Throughout school I struggled maintaining even an average GPA and would often procrastinate and take shortcuts to pass classes. It's always been like this.

I somehow managed to graduate though thanks to help from some teachers I appreciate dearly, and immediately jumped into college. I jumped between majors and struggled to complete work in my general education classes as I would have trouble focusing on texts and would regress to my old procrastinating ways. The stress from this would build up and eventually led to me dropping college completely. I hated myself for this, but at the time I just couldn't take it.

I would often get extra help throughout school, I am not sure what is up with me, but it is entirely possible that I am on the autism spectrum. Throughout all my years in school since I was in elementary, I have heard talk about it regarding me and my behavior in class. I have always been a little different even I admit. This isn't an excuse for anything, but I just thought it would be important background information.

I am now an adult and man I sure don't feel like one. They often say ""Comparison is the thief of joy"" and I think that is definitely true in my case. I compare myself to my peers and often feel embarrassed and ashamed. They are all so much more ahead of me in life, from my perspective at least. Right now I am applying to jobs but haven't had any luck whatsoever. I am learning to drive but procrastinating getting a license as well(shocker).

I continue to have night terrors and nightmares that has this evil voice telling me im worthless and must end my life. I try to avoid sleep cause of it.

 I have no friends and the only family i have that talk to me are my parents, who my father subjected me to years of emotional and physical abuse due to alcoholism(which caused and led to a PTSD diagnosis) (age 3-15) and constantly yells at me to tell me im ruining his life by asking to borrow money when i have no money to eat. (I moved out on my own years ago) and my mom who only calls me to talk about how proud she is of my younger brother.


The only good thing that has happened to me this year is us getting a new apartment. That quickly became a nightmare as the above tenant is so loud, it spiraled my depression out of control and causes PTSD attacks.

I feel like the world has closed in on me and im hopeless. I just want my suffering to end. I have no self worth. I hate who i am. I cant afford proper help and the psychiatrist who they did provide to me has used me as a lab rat and keeps giving me different meds, all of which have caused liver issues (medically diagnosed) worse depression and created an agry side of me.

I just wish and pray i will stop suffering. I can hardly afford to eat anymore and cant even afford different meds. Im so scared and feel empty inside. I cant handle another battle like i endured in 2017.

The myth is Canada offers free health care and help but the care you get for free is nothing more than people who wont let you open up and instead push meds on you. I even had a therapist tell me im selfish for ever considering suicide. 

I used to be able to call my Uncle to help me, but he unfortunately passed away in last January. He was the man who acted like a real father to me from day one. No one else cares about me it seems.

This is me venting and also crying out for help. I dont know how much fight is left in me. Im only 32 and feel like my life is over. To finish, i was diagnosed with PTSD, severe anxiety, Severe depression and ADHD.

im so upset. im completely out of their life now, by their gf who has apologised for the way she acted a year later but only because i was in the wards and she wanted to relieve herself of any guilt. i understand gfs being uncomfortable with their partners bsf, especially since we r the opposite sex, and i was doing my absolute best to be kind, to get to onow her seperately from her partner, to include her in whatever i could, to really be her friend because i thought she was so cool. 

but she misunderstood absolitsly everything i did, and berated me for it. she lied about thinfs my ex bsf said, berated me for thinfs that were out of my control, accused me of trying to ruin their relationship maliciously even though i tried to communicate so often to make sure i wasnt making them uncomfortable but only ever got responses telling me i was overthinking and being silly. while she berated me my ex bsf ghosted me out of the blue and didnt stand up for me once, despite the lies she was telling that i KNEW were lies. and then her and her feiends proceeded to harass me online. the only time they talked to me was after they got my suicide note, but even then after i couldnt accept their gfs apology at that time, they ghosted me and their gf started harassing me again. all because i told her that the situation had a big impact on my life and i needed time to come to terms with it before i could really accept it.

im just. so shaken. i have no closure. i dont know my ex bsfs side of the story at all, which sucks because we used to communicate so openly, and every time i try and reach out im left with being ghosted again. i genuinely have zero clue what i did wrong, im assuming its because their gf is uncomft which again i completely understand but the way it was all handled was genuinely just straight up bullying and i never thought id have to deal with that after highschool cool ever again.

i understand that me being the girl best friend already gives a bad first impression for anyone that finds this post, but trust me when i say i saw me and them as truly platonic, and vice versa. i never knowingly did or said anything to try and get in the way, i did a lot to try and minimise discomfort. im just at such a loss. what do you do when the only person you could ever be yourself around, and the only person who truly got you and vice versa,  just disappears without a trace. how am i even supposed to pick up the pieces when i dont know what made it shatter in the first place.

18d52g4,Cancer changed my fathers personality and I can't cope,mentalhealth,1701981778.0,1,8,"My father got diagnosed with lung cancer about a month ago. It came out of nowhere, I got a call on monday morning to work that he is in a hospital, because he assaulted my grandpa. Apparently, he got a seizure and started shouting and talking to non-existent people. The cause of said seizure were two tumors on his brain, which the doctors later reavelad to be metastasis of lung cancer.

  
Since then, my father is a different person. He is often saying stuff that doesn't make any sense, remembering moments long ago and (kinda understandably) throwing money all around at new experiences, be it traveling or concert tickets.

  
He also started saying things he would never say before, repeat phrases and contradicting himself in the same breath. He is constantly saying he had three tumors, but he killed two of them, that the tumor in his chest is gone and constantly making up new stuff about his health, situation, experiences and logic. I don't know what is true anymore.

  
I cry, but I am also mostly scared and angry. Angry that he smoked 60 cigarettes a day,  even tho his own father died of lung cancer at 49. Angry, that he didn't care about his health and the fact he will leave me alone. They don't have a relationship with my mother, they are basically separated. When my father was released from the hospital, my mother broke down crying that she is scared he will do something to her. This all happened two weeks after grandma died... also of lung cancer.

  
Me and my father never had a great relationship. He didn't spend time with me when I was little and later on, he started heavily drinking. He recovered from alcoholism three years back and that was the first time in our lives we finally started to have a bond. I started helping out with the family bussiness and  for the first time in my life, I openly talked about my girlfriend and sexuality.

  
Now all that is gone. There are traces of these two peaceful years in him, but they are covered in nonsense and gibberish. I hardly know enough to take over the family bussiness, so I am lost at what to do now. I don't want his hard work go to waste, but he is in no state to hold my hand anymore. My mother can't provide for herself alone and I am an only child. I am scared of the burden I have to solve now and I am broken that I can't even talk to him about it, because... he is not there.

  
I feel cynical and disgusting for talking about me and my battle in this moment, when his must be much harder. But on top of my BPD, this feels like too much for me to handle. I can't go to my mother or my grandma for help and I feel like I have to hold it together, because everything will crumble otherwise. I don't know what to do, I really can't imagine having to spend my life without his support and guidance. After thirty years, he finally started to be a father for me... and I have to lose him now?

- Exercise
- Some short task that is important & urgent e.g. sending documents

I started with doing a 30 minute brisk walk/jog, then signed up for weekly muay thai classes to raise my peak activity threshold.

It‚Äôs a hectic job with little room for mistakes, but understanding colleagues give me leeway to learn. 

The stress of the job pushes me to a neurotic, suicidal state of mind at least once per shift, which ironically trains my mental threshold. But it made me realize I couldn‚Äôt stay in jobs like these forever, and had to go back to focusing on studies to sustain myself better(I‚Äôm 19).

I do struggle with BPD, but theres nothing that really triggers me to feel that empty most of the time, I'm alright being on my own (I believe).
I also do the things usually recommend to get rid of that feeling, I workout everyday, I consume mostly positive content, eat healthy, and do creative hobbies.

I also had some weird brief hallucinations(?) that really scared me. I would like some help/advice/comfort.

I've had a very strange sleep pattern the last couple days and trying to sleep has been very scary for me. I took a nap that ended up lasting a little too long today and woke up at night. since then I've felt a lot of emotions, but mostly feeling strange and dissociated. I've been questioning whether or not I just got a fever because of how tonight has been going. While trying to sleep I've had big spikes in anxiety and confusion, with some hallucinations.

I have visual snow syndrome (you can google it) which makes sleeping very hard as the static slowly turns to weird shapes and lights when I close my eyes, usually fading when I open my eyes, sometimes causing everything to slightly flash. This all gets really bad when I have a night like this because it's really bad for my anxiety to have to not focus on all the shit I'm seeing while trying to sleep.

Typically if I'm tired enough it's not the biggest deal, but tonight I saw some weird stuff I've never experienced before. the first time something new happened was literally just the static momentarily disappearing, which was extremely strange for me since I've had it my whole life. The second thing was a straight up jumpscare in my vision, I've never even seen anything other than shapes and colors trying to sleep, so this really messed me up. My heart was beating super fast and everything in the room appeared to shake really fast. The third thing was the static going away for  about a half-second again, but then I saw a quick glimpse of a vhs tape.. This makes no sense to me because I was pretty awake.

It doesn't help that I would be consistently confused by just opening my eyes and trying to figure out what I'm seeing in the dark static. I've been dissociating for quite a while now, longer than it usually lasts, and I'm just hoping for things to get better or some advice.

13sum97,I am a broken man both mentally and physically. So I jumped on a bike and started pedalling across the country. I'm not stopping until I hit the other side.,mentalhealth,1685151418.0,68,310,"Hi everyone, 

About a month ago I started to think about Cycling across country, two weeks later I left Moncton NB at 1pm in the afternoon and haven't looked back, tomorrow I will cross into Quebec. 

I think this is interesting for a few reasons. 

1- As I said, I am fat and out of shape. I am 44m 6'5 320lbs and have not exercised in any meaningful way in 20 years. I have bad knees, bad back, apnea and I'm type 2 diabetic. 

2- Mentally, I'm broken. I suffer from really bad depression, bipolar 2 and Chemicaly Induced Anxiety Disorder. 

3- I was raised as a ward of the court, 30+ foster homes, street kid, jail, addiction. Been a hard road. 



So why on earth am I doing this? Two main reasons. First and foremost BC is my home province, they recently passed into law funding for school for former wards of the court regardless of age. I plan on taking full advantage of this and I think this should be the standard across all provinces. I have stagnated in the same industry for years and have hit a ceiling. If I ever want to retire and leave something behind for my girls I need something more. And education is where I'll start. 


Secondly, if I am to be successful with my schooling I need to get my head in order. Because of my CIAD I can't take antidepressants, so all my mental health issues I tackle on my own. And frankly depression is winning. I could fly out to BC and be there 12hrs from now, but I will end up being the same man. 

However, the man that can jump on a bike and pedal his ass all the way to Vancouver Island, that man can do anything. He can regain control of his mental health, he can regain his physical health and he can dedicate a healthy body and mind to his schooling. 

So I want to try and bring some awareness to the mental health struggles and the ward of the court funding thing. 


It's been over two weeks since I've left and there's been some hard dark moments, but there's been some empowering ones too. I'm already down about 20lbs, there's strength in my legs and back ive not felt since I was a teenager, I'm about to cross into a new province and I thought it was worth sharing with this community. 

I have already been posting in another subreddit since I started and they've all been so amazing. 

I have been posting almost daily updates to my insta and tiktok but if I understand correctly I can't link them here on this subreddit? I also have a blog I've been writing when I have time. 

Both the blog and videos are not a magical Xmas land type of upbeat energetic thing. I talk about and show both the ups and downs of mental health and this monumental challenge I've taken on. 


I hope there's a few of you who might pass me on your drives, don't hesitate giving me a honk or a wave. I'll be the big fat guy on a mountain bike :)

He broke up with me out of the blue and now after talking with each other every day for five years he's just not in my life anymore. I really thought he was my person. I don't know how I'm supposed to cope with losing the most important person in my life. 

I'm in therapy, I already did an IOP. I'm on antidepressants. I spend time with friends, talk regularly to my family, and am participating in hobbies. But I feel zero enjoyment in life. It's been three months of this literally when will this end? I still love, miss, and want him back. It's my first heartbreak so I don't know how long this is supposed to take.

Literally everything about the world would have to change, and even then would it be like I imagine? Because part of my fantasy is that I'm happy and no matter what happens I don't think I could ever feel that way. And after how long of fantasizing about a life that I could never have and emotions I could never feel, at what point do I just accept that this reality will never be anywhere near what I want to experience, do I just have to accept it and give up? At what point do I just have to say that living will never be enjoyable and just end it all? I don't want to appear negative or down but at this point it feels like a fact.

Since I (25, F) moved to a new country, I have been having emotional breakdowns out of the blue almost every day for the past couple of months (to be fair, this is a familiar pattern for me, when big changes happen or big stressors are present in my life, but I can't live like this anytime something changes). I hate how unstable I feel. I can wake up feeling anxious, spend my day calming down only to break down again to feel fine in the evening. These breakdowns involve (what feels like) endless negative thought spirals, about how I'm not good enough, not smart enough, not disciplined enough, and so forth. This is followed by feeling even worse over the amount of self-pity I have for myself and how little I am doing to change anything about it. Then the cycle continues until I am exhausted and slowly start feeling normal again.

My partner is supportive, but he doesn't understand. He tells me he doesn't understand how I can make little things so big and this question leaves me with only more hopelessness. I feel bad that he has to witness these breakdowns and I wish him a healthier girlfriend.

14bnwvw,How can I help my suicidal wife who tried to OD yesterday and STILL won't go to the hospital? I'm at wits end and I'm exhausted,mentalhealth,1686998719.0,99,119,"Update 2-
They are discharging her. Wtf is she that good at hiding shit or is psych at the hospital stupid. Shes texting me so she's been cleared by psych. She keeps saying I love you, and I just want to scream. Think a thick foam pillow would middle scream? 

the system fails again.  So tired of this I can't take care her mental needs. I just want to shut down I'm so stressed I'm hallucinating vividly. reality is weird. 

I still haven't slept probably won't till way later. 

Why do I even try to get her help when the medical system just doesn't care. 

The stray who I fed and let sleep on the porch came by severely injured. I will spare y'all the details. We have no money nor car for a vet.mil said to call animal control. He is an elderly at least 12 years old feral stray with no teeth. I highly doubt they will spend a dime to save him.

 It like when it rains it pours. That cat let me and only me pet him even though hes been here longer then me. We had a bond. He came home looking for help. I'm glad I was there to help him, he got right into the carrier I put outside to trap him so he didn't wander off. 

  I'm overwhelmed

Update 1- texted the 988 line someone commented. They walked em through calling 911 stayed on the line with me.  My wife is beyond pissed off at me
 She yelled at the emts for not wearing masks in our house.  But she ended up going because the emts told her it wasn't optional the amount she took was considered a suicide attempt. She didn't even look at me as she left.

I know I did the right thing. I should have done it sooner.

_____

OP

She tried to OD today she's only not in the hospital cause she threatened to leave me if I caused her to be in the psych ward again. But she took TWO huge according to her handfuls of her old lithium that for some reason didn't get thrown out. She says she did throw up about 20 minutes after taking them. So no idea how much actually got into her system.

I sat with her all day in her room and now we both have our bedroom doors open so we can hear each other and easily check on each other ,(our rooms are right next to each other we literally talk by simply talking loud) 

She won't go to the hospital I keep begging her. She has been dangerously suicidal for a year EVERY day she tells me in tears she wants to die. 
She says she will make an appt with a psychiatrist on Monday but she rarely ever keeps her psych appointments she always makes excuses even if it's a telehealth visit. Even if she does and they prescribe meds she won't take them. She will for a week and then stop saying they make her feel weird. I try explaining that that is normal and will go away but she would rather stop the meds entirely.

How can I help her get the help she needs? She says she isn't suicidal right now,but that's besides the pint she took a ton of lithium she needs to be monitored.
I'd prefer she go in the morning to the ER and from there the psych ward for medication management. She says she will take the meds if we go through scheduling on Monday but even so it could take months for her to get in to see someone psychiatrists are heavily booked in our area.

I'm scared I'm going to wake up and find her dead. She needs help asap and I'm not sure how to get her help without losing the relationship in the process.",at my wits end

I feel like getting a job is almost impossible for me and it makes me feel like such a failure and stuff. I still live with my mum and it's crushing me.

i'd say it went downhill in sept. i lost my job. my car took a shit. still haven't found a job and still haven't gotten my car fixed. i've been applying every single day and haven't gotten a call back.

mid sept i lost my best friend to suicide. we knew each other since middle school and have been close since then. granted this last year we didn't  hang out or talk much, she was still my bff. now she's just gone forever. i'll never get to see her or talk to her again.

days after finding that out, my dad, who has a history of blowing up and going off the rails, decided to blow up at me, calling me a ""stupid fucking cunt just like mommy"", ""bitch"", ""childish"", etc. among many other things. so i blocked him and haven't had any contact with him since.

on a lighter note, me and my long distance ex-boyfriend got in contact again (we ended on decent terms and were chillin, i think), and he flew out to come see me and comfort me during all of this which was a breath of fresh air. i didn't expect that from him.

but yeah fast forward to about last week. i got into it with my mom, very toxic shit went down. to summarize she wanted me to leave the house, i didn't want to, so cue the yelling and screaming and guilt tripping. she almost broke my door down as well. this was all after i dealt with her trying to kill herself (took away her guns) due to her and her boyfriend at the time having some difficulties. 

on top of all of this i've been wanting support and a shoulder to cry on and someone to listen to me. because i don't have ANYONE. my ex is the person i go to for comfort but he has his own stuff he's dealing with and can't be there for me like i need. i also can't rely on him. which really FUCKING sucks. we got into it a few times over some dumb shit and i feel like i ruined that again.

and today i get messages from people saying my dad went to the hospital for seizures and he feels like he's on his deathbed and wants to see me. but i don't know if it's just a tactic for him to want to see me or not. 

i just don't know anymore. i go to therapy. i'm not on any medication because my medicaid apparently doesn't cover it anymore and without a job it's difficult to start. i'm leaving home to go visit my ex in california for my birthday in a little over two weeks so im hoping that getting out of the house will do me good. if shit just doesn't work out i don't know if i can continue doing this anymore. i've had my fair share of mental health issues but this one feels like my breaking point. i don't want to hear ""it'll get better! ü§ì‚òùÔ∏è"" because it surely doesn't feel like it. i felt pretty decent before all of this. i just don't know what to do anymore. thanks for listening if you made it this far.",at my wits end

The problem is every time i lash out, it gets worse. My ability to keep it together worsen each time. It's straining my family and our relationship.

My family don't understand, they sometimes mean good but they just wont get it and cannot provide the empathy i seek. So, i am going back seeking mental health help.

1c9hrxb,"I‚Äôm at my wits end, and could really use some outside advice. ",mentalhealth,1713705725.0,2,3,"This is my first post on Reddit, and I‚Äôm using my mobile so apologies for any formatting issues.


I (30m) have had mental health issues for as long as I can remember. I‚Äôve always had severe depression, general anxiety, social anxiety, and binge eating issues. 

About a year and a half ago, I finally started seeing a psychiatrist in hopes of figuring things out and mapping out a course to help these issues. I‚Äôve always been poor, growing up and even now in adulthood, but I finally got some decent health insurance through a new job at the time and I was referred to a place that generally only handles lower income patients, and mostly operate on sliding pay rates. This is purely information to help give context on the place I received my services. I also see a separate therapist at this location as well. 

For clarity, I‚Äôll refer to my psychiatrist as my doctor, and therapist as therapist so I don‚Äôt confuse myself in this story. 

At first, my doctor told me it was very likely I had adhd as well as severe depression and anxiety. She was also stood firm on believing my anxiety is linked to my depression. To start she prescribed me adderall, and an antidepressant (Paxil I believe). I‚Äôve been on the adderall ever since, and it‚Äôs worked very well for my day to day focus and learning. As for the antidepressants; it did not go well. I‚Äôve been changed from about 6 different ones so far for various reasons. Either they don‚Äôt help, leave me in a zombie like state, or have awful side effects. I was on Wellbutrin 300mg xr the longest but it was awful for making me very irritable all the time. 2 months ago she switched me to cymbalta and once again there‚Äôs no help. It took away the ups and downs and made everything grey, with occasionally down cycles. She‚Äôs also barely wanted to acknowledge my crippling anxiety and only ever given me off label medications that might work but never do. The most notable being lamotrigine. And of course, it didn‚Äôt do anything for me. 

I guess my question for everyone is what have you found that helped you? Has anyone else been through a bunch of anti depressants and nothing worked? Going through all this has just left me utterly defeated and I have no idea what to do. I don‚Äôt want to sound insulting, but it feels like sometimes whatever I have going on is outside these folks range of ability. Like I‚Äôm a square peg they‚Äôre trying to jam into a circle hole. 

Thank you in advance to anyone who reads this or comments. Please share your stories as well, as sometimes it‚Äôs comforting in a way to know you‚Äôre at least not alone. ",at my wits end

Yes you display all symptoms, that‚Äôs what it is). I am currently on the waiting list for an ADHD referral (in my local area, the NHS waiting list is around 5 years- ridiculous!). I have previously been prescribed citalopram, duloxetine, mirtazapine and am currently taking sertraline (max dosage) and amitriptyline. Have previously done CBT in person and online and found it no help.

I have recently (past 3 months or so) been very low and have been having suicidal thoughts (no plans to act on it), struggling to get out of bed most days, with no appetite and poor sleep. I contacted my Dr who has said they plan to refer me again for CBT, and to wean me off sertraline before putting me on Venlafaxine. 

I‚Äôve found sertraline to be the closest to success I‚Äôve had with antidepressants, and I‚Äôm aware that it is also prescribed for the treatment of OCD (unsure if it is helping me with these symptoms) so I am reluctant to change. 

I am just looking for advice as I feel like I‚Äôm constantly being fobbed off by the Drs, having never been referred to a psychiatrist and told to try meditating or the headspace app. I‚Äôm at my wits end, feeling so low, trying a never-ending cycle of antidepressants and told to try apps and CBT.

Myself and most of my best friend's friends think that John is in love with my best friend, which is an issue bc they are not the same sexuality. And though John doesn't say their feelings out loud, John is very hostile to everyone but my best friend (bf). John is also fairly mean to bf and has caused them to be set back mentally and confidence wise far too many times. Bf has vented about issues that keep arising in their friendship to myself and other friends. We keep telling bf to cut off John, bf doesn't heed our advice. We don't like John. Well for some reason bf told John we know everything that has happened between them and how we feel about John. John obviously got angry. John started gaslighting bf even more. Calling them a terrible person and that bf needs to apologize and that John doesn't know nearly as much about me as I know about John and thinks it's not fair. I told bf that people don't feel the need talk about the good and fun times nearly as much as the bad times. Bad times are heavy and weigh us down and we need others to help carry those burdens, hence we vent. But now bf feels guilty about talking about John bc John said it was a bad thing and that others don't need to know their business. 

Throughout all of this, I was trying to make sure bf knew I was there for them and kept a level head and I treated them gently when the worst kept coming. But after a certain point, I think bf just stopped listening to reason and I couldn't put forth the energy to help them. They stopped listening to me being gentle, I became impassioned.

I got this email from my mother 2 days ago. I found it before I got in bed last night, and I‚Äôve been awake ever since. (It‚Äôs 6am in NZ)

I lived with this woman my whole life, enduring physical assaults and emotional abuse for years as a child. At 16, I had a restraining order against her and went to live full-time with my grandparents until I moved out of town as a young adult. I cut her off completely

Since becoming an adult and making my own life, I allowed her back into my life slowly and with a lot of boundaries, in hopes of being able to finally push her to get the help she‚Äôs always needed. It wasn‚Äôt easy, there have been many situations where I should‚Äôve cut her off for good, but I was scared if I didn‚Äôt keep her happy then she would take it out on my siblings.

In the end, she chose not to get help, the abuse got really bad again and she started sending me horrible messages again, so at the end of last year I finally blocked her again.

Now, I‚Äôm 28 years old, I own my own home with my fianc√© (who is amazing), I‚Äôm excelling in my career, yet I‚Äôm broken. I just can‚Äôt take it anymore, I just want her out of my life for good so I can focus on my own life as I prepare to marry my partner and start a family of our own, but with every nasty text, email or message, I just shatter more and more. I‚Äôm scared to become a mother and I end up just like her.

Over the last 12 years of this, I‚Äôve dealt with NZ Police, Child Welfare services, Hospitals & Mental Health services. I have over ten years worth of screenshots of horrible messages she sent me, everything has been reported and nothing has happened because she‚Äôs ‚Äúnot threatening‚Äù, but someone out there has to agree that this is NOT OKAY to send someone and REGARDLESS of anyone‚Äôs mental health situation, behaviour like this has to be held accountable. Am I just supposed to ignore it and pretend it doesn‚Äôt affect me anymore? I‚Äôm at my wits end. I‚Äôm depressed, I feel hopeless, I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Please someone just tell me what to do to end this for good (besides obviously getting therapy. I‚Äôve been through therapy and counselling before, but I can‚Äôt afford it right now so it‚Äôs not an option for me). Or even if you can give me some insight, maybe you‚Äôve dealt with something similar?

I have a few productive days here and there, but most days feel like a struggle. I recently moved to a new country and have a job interview this week, but I feel no motivation to prepare for it. On top of that, I‚Äôm dealing with relationship issues, and I just want this day to be over. Every time I get a birthday message from a friend or family member, I end up in tears. I don‚Äôt even feel like cutting a cake today.

Edit: I just want to thank each and every single one of you for the birthday wishes and advice, it truly helped me make my day so much better and reminded me that we‚Äôre all lonely together!! I ended up having a way better day than expected. Always remember that bad days do not make up your entire life, take it one day at a time and i‚Äôll try to do the same :)) ",lonely

I was sure something was wrong with me and that i was going to die. My heart was going so fast, i had a horrible headache, my whole body was shaking, i had extreme dizziness and i couldnt see straight (everything was blurry/blacked out). It took me about 15 minutes to actually call 911 i kept thinking i was having a stroke or something. My thoughts about dying wouldn‚Äôt stop and i kept repeating ‚Äúi dont wanna die‚Äù over and over. Calling 911 was scary on its own, cause it was the first time i was calling. I told them what was happening and while crying and barely controlling my words.

The first responders came and took my pulse and walked me through my breathing, i was shaking so bad. And then the paramedics came and took my vitals and they told me i was fine, they reassured me that it was probably a panic attack and i wasnt about to die and they told me my uncontrollable shaking was probably due to adrenaline... It‚Äôs my finals and im stressing so much about my exams and i spent the whole day at the library and barely ate, so looking back this was definitely because of anxiety.

Now i feel stupid because i called 911 only because i was having a panic attack. Has this happened to anyone?? I feel like i overreacted and now i just have more anxiety over it. ",panic attacks

Over the last 10 years, i have been on psychiatric medications (mainly anti depressants/SSRI‚Äôs) for my insomnia. I have stopped them all and the last time i‚Äôve been on medication was 3 years ago (mirtazapine). Mirtazapine made me gain so much weight, and i was dependent on it. Withdrawal was horrible.

I generally hate being dependent on such medications, and i feel like they may temporarily help me sleep, but i usually grow tolerance after a few months and they cause me other issues.

Recently I have been going through an extremely tough time (sleep-wise), and I just cant cope anymore. I have a job that requires me to be there at 7AM, on most days i‚Äôm late and i‚Äôm like a zombie, pretty much soulless. 
I have a family and 2 toddlers and it‚Äôs just so exhausting trying to juggle between work and my kids as both require immense energy.

Going through a week of work is literally torture for me, i operate on minimal to no sleep and i compensate for the lack of sleep by taking naps during the day and i remain stuck on a cycle of sleeplessness. I know im not supposed to nap, but even when i dont nap, i dont get the sufficient sleep my mind needs, and i end up even more tired.

I have really been resisting getting back into medication, hoping that ill be able to slip back into a good flow of inner peace and manage to sleep sufficiently without the medication, but its just not happening and i feel like i‚Äôm slowly dying.

I recently saw a psychiatrist and he prescribed me trazodone. I still haven‚Äôt dispensed it from the pharmacy as i have been hesitant to start taking it.

Its too much, im already fighting a battle 24/7 and I do not wanna attempt to work even harder than what is physically possible.

""you should"" ""why dont you"" but when I reply that I don't have time and energy for a job or whatever they want me to do, they reply that I'm just lazzy and privileged.

I guess that someone who has always been mentally healthy cannot understand what it feels like to be unmotivated, to be physically tired or mentally, to have a brain that does not function well, to wake up tired even after 9 hours of sleep.

1jnayr8,Burnouts and Mood Swings,mentalhealth,1743336250.0,6,1,"Hi.  I wasn't sure who to reach out to but I just wanted to make a post about how I'm feeling recently. 

  
I read an article recently that there have been an increase of Gen Z (18-28) who have been experiencing burnouts. I've been experiencing quite a lot of it and the ""adults"" (above the age 30) around me have just told me that I'm just overreacting or making excuses. Some of it is understandable, since I've had ""mood swings"" from time to time as a child. But sometimes I would just want to end it all, not do anything or just disappear. 

I've read blogs that say that I should seek support (at my job) but that doesn't really seem the best for my situation since they've told me once before that everyone experiences these things and it's my choice to overcome it or not. Nothing about how or anything but I guess that's what adulting is. 

I was born and raised in Japan, still work and live in Japan so all this mental health stuff is‚Äîas you may or may not know‚Äîswept under the rug. Which is another reason I haven't even had a diagnosis for ADHD since my parents just tell me I'm making excuses for myself being so incompetent. I feel ashamed to even talk about it with the people living with me. The stress of making a living when everything is so expensive, inflation yada yada, wanting to settle, to marry but being socially awkward, I don't really know how to bond with people.

- daily meditation
- stretching and minimal exercise (I don't have time to work out more than 5 minutes)

I‚Äôm a 32 year old female, and I‚Äôve been doing CrossFit for just over two years. I absolutely love my box, the community is amazing and I‚Äôve made some great friends. My ideal schedule is 4 WODs per week, and I‚Äôm the kind of person who has to give 110% in every session.

Unfortunately over the last year my health has taken a bad turn. I‚Äôve had really bad fatigue, sleep issues, dizziness and bad anxiety and depression. I‚Äôm undiagnosed ADHD, but I think this has cause a flare up in symptoms too. I feel terrible most days at the gym even after a good sleep and eating clean, and I‚Äôm constantly in fight or flight mode. I‚Äôve had countless blood tests and body scans done which all say I‚Äôm healthy, so I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I‚Äôm overtraining.

I‚Äôve finally decided (with an absolute struggle) that I need to give my body time to recover. But I have some overwhelming worries, and I‚Äôm concerned that I may rush back to do a WOD too soon. I‚Äôve come to realise that it‚Äôs almost like an addiction.

My biggest concerns are:

That I‚Äôve built up a reputation for being dedicated, strong and a top performer, that I‚Äôll be forgotten about and that others will come in and outperform me when I‚Äôm away.

That I‚Äôll lose all of my ‚Äúgains‚Äù and skills if I need to take several months away, and that I won‚Äôt look as toned and muscular as I do now.

That I‚Äôll lose my mind and have nothing to fill my time with and nothing to focus on or achieve. I work in an office every day, but I hate my job and I‚Äôm struggling to get interviews for a new one.

That my friends at the gym will forget about me if they don‚Äôt see me every day and that I‚Äôll maybe miss out on informal invites to socialise. I‚Äôve always struggled making friends, so I don‚Äôt want to lose them.

That it‚Äôs unclear how long it will take me to feel better, or if I return to CrossFit after a period of time I will get unwell again and never be able to perform at the same level. I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôve done permanent damage to my body/mind and that I won‚Äôt ever fully recover.

I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice to address my worries so that I avoid intense exercise for a while and any tips on how to talk to myself as I want to avoid flare ups of anxiety and depression during this time. 

If you have a shared experience, I‚Äôd love to hear from you too!

* Guided sessions with meditation and mindfulness that help me reset.
* A retreat that involves nature immersion with fresh air and lush trees.
* Ability to spend time in solitude with a program that's not too rigid.
* Enjoy a scenic view of a body of water (lake/ocean).
* Ideal time duration of 7-10 days.
* *Not*¬†prioritizing a luxury resort that includes spa, massages, etc. -- these are nice-to-haves.

I‚Äôve got no real friends, i didn‚Äôt get a happy birthday message this year and i haven‚Äôt for the past couple of years. i hate myself and anything i do. i recently broke up with a girlfriend of three years and she got a new man within a month, which further solidifies that i have no likeable traits. i struggle to deal with emotion and i don‚Äôt know how to express anything or help anyone with anything. no matter what i do i‚Äôm not able to improve. i find comfort in my own sadness and im fine with that, in a weird way i like feeling miserable. it‚Äôs like i‚Äôve got something going for me , like a game of how long it‚Äôll go on for. recently i‚Äôve turned to alcohol and i‚Äôve been drinking more than i should be. when i‚Äôve tried to talk to someone they‚Äôre like good on you or something. but it‚Äôs the only time i feel happy and so i need to keep doing it as much as possible. and i‚Äôve had this itching urge to sh but i don‚Äôt want people to see or know. i just feel terrible 24/7 and no one seems to notice or care lol

1hor1vj," My boyfriend is depressed, and my needs/issues not being met only seem to make things worse. TW; substance abuse and suicidal ideation",mentalhealth,1735457838.0,0,1,"Throw away account for obvious reasons. As I type this my boyfriend is passed out drunk on the couch next to me, he passed out mid this\* conversation. He is depressed and not taking care of himself in anyway. He's not eating right, making poor choices, not taking care of personal hygiene in the slightest. He acknowledges all of it but he doesn't care or want to live. He wont take steps to get help or feel better. 

He's done some awful things to me; it has caused some big strife in the relationship. All the while I still love him and want what is best for him, even if that means we're not together. I've thought about leaving, I've taken space and come home.  In these fights; he's awful, and I now get so frustrated and angry because he becomes impossible to talk to. He drinks and it makes the communication harder. He goes for low blows, its like he wants to give me a reason to leave. I end up telling him I hate him. I regret it, but in the moment that is all I feel.   
I don't know how to get him to get help. He is in online therapy. I don't know if he's been going but I have no way of knowing. He refuses to take it seriously, he just thinks its stupid. All the while I say if that isn't working maybe you should go to your PCP and talk about your depression, he won't. He definitely puts a lot of self worth in my view or want of him. The less he cares, the more issues arise for me, the more I say, the worse he feels. He'll treat me poorly, and any communication of my needs or feelings, he sinks lower just hearing them. He has no motivation to do anything about it, he wallows. He refuses help, he refuses the idea of meds. He goes to work, drinks, and eats bad food and sleeps. I have tried countless times to get him to take it seriously. I don't know how to help him; , because anything I say; its like ""op another thing wrong with me."" So I feel like I can't communicate my needs without it taking him lower. I don't mean to be hurting him.

He says things like he's afraid of doctors  though he needs to see them, he doesn't like therapy and doesn't want to be on meds. He isn't taking care of his hygiene, his house, he doesn't clean, engages in risk taking behavior. His only concerns are making money but there are solid moments when he feels good and its usually in correlation of when the relationship is doing well.

He needs to get help, he just comfortably talks about wanting to die. He says he doesn't want his parents insurance charged for therapy or meds. Idk what they would say. I can't manage it alone. Do I tell them and risk him never forgiving me? His uncle recently died because he never got sober. It would terrify his mother but I don't know what else to do. He would think of my telling them as a betrayal. 

I don't know how to get the confidence to tell them that he needs help? And that its too much to handle alone. He gets bad sometimes when drinking, and its changing me as a person, I'm so quick to anger and be on the offensive now. I start to feel like he's out to get me. I don't necessarily think that's the truth, but he doesn't trust anyone, and in that environment, with someone who is so quick to see the worst in people, never trusting me, its changing me. Do I take space and leave for now? I know its ""not my responsibility"" or whatever people want to say but we've been together almost 3 years, is involving his parents the right thing?",substance abuse

I suffered some very traumatic sexual abuse last year multiple times. I thought I got away from it and have spent the past year trying to heal. I've been hospitalized, in a partial hospitalization program, and intensive outpatient programs multiple times each since then. When none of those were helping, I tried getting sober instead, went to rehab and did an 8 week recovery program twice. I made very little progress and had given up in hopes time would provide the healing I need. But it happened again, exactly 3 weeks ago, with someone else. I don't know how to escape this trauma and whatever little healing I managed was undone in that moment. My family has me on unofficial suicide watch right now after I told them my plan. I don't think hospitalization will help at this point. I think it would just be another traumatic experience and it's done nothing to help and has only left me with nightmares. I'm trying to look into residential programs after someone suggested there were ones exclusively for mental health but everything I'm finding is all substance abuse programs. I don't what to do that again. I don't want to be treated like an addict again. But I need help before I do something I can't undo. I'd ask my therapist but I'm scared if she knew how bad things have gotten, she'd go for the nuclear option and try tricking me until the ambulance arrives again. ",substance abuse

Whether I get this need met from a one night stand or from a long term girlfriend, it‚Äôs pretty much the same to me. I just want to soak it up for hours, even days, instead of getting out of bed. It feels like a drug. It‚Äôs intoxicating. 

I never hear other men talking about this, at least not anywhere near the extreme level of need I seem to have for this. And it makes me feel ashamed, like I‚Äôm childish or something. 

I‚Äôm not someone who felt touch starved growing up, and I‚Äôve had a handful of long-term girlfriends where I got tons of affection. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm really conventionally unattractive and people are repulsed by me - I‚Äôm at least average looking. ",addiction

Even when we know we should validate ourselves, there‚Äôs still that itch to hear, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing great,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI see you, I value you.‚Äù And when we don‚Äôt get it? That doubt creeps in.

It‚Äôs wild when you think about it. Logically, we know external validation shouldn‚Äôt define us. But psychologically? We‚Äôre wired to seek it. Humans are social creatures..our brains are literally designed to seek approval because, for most of human history, survival depended on being accepted by the group. Feeling excluded? That wasn‚Äôt just rejection; that was a death sentence back in the day. So yeah, this runs deep.

But here‚Äôs where it gets tricky. When you rely too much on external validation, you give other people control over how you feel about yourself. If they praise you, you‚Äôre on top of the world. If they don‚Äôt, suddenly you‚Äôre doubting everything. That‚Äôs a dangerous cycle because you end up chasing approval rather than building real self-worth.

Self-validation, on the other hand, is like an internal muscle..you have to strengthen it over time. It‚Äôs about being able to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of myself,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI trust my own judgment,‚Äù without needing a round of applause to confirm it. And the more you do it, the less dependent you become on whether or not people give you that stamp of approval.

qtn1or,7 days cocaine free,mentalhealth,1636885428.0,15,14,"I don't know if this is the right community to post in but drug addiction has been fairly central to the decline in my mental health so hopefully this is OK.

I've used cocaine sporadically for 20 years but around two years ago this began to drastically increase as I started to use it as a coping mechanism for stressful life events, namely losing family members, covid and lockdown, employment worries and, most significantly of all, the deterioration and ultimate dissolution of my marriage.

Although I've used cocaine to help me cope with these issues I know that what I was really doing was escaping and running away from them rather than dealing with them. I've always known that, but once my usage increased I quickly lost control and cocaine has merely exacerbated all my problems until it brought things crashing down.

Cocaine leads to me drinking more, both these things lead to me spending less time with my family and caring less about my work, all of these lead to me feeling more depressed and self loathing, and the cycle goes around again.

Recently things crashed hard. My marriage finally came to an end, my relationship with my children is on thin ice, my feelings of being bad, unloved and worthless brought me to the brink of suicide (again). I've had enough of being controlled by cocaine.

I flushed the remainder of my stash, deleted all my numbers and re-engaged with my support worker. That was last Sunday. Although my material situation is pretty miserable right now and I've got a lot of difficulties to negotiate in the near future, I do feel better in myself in a way that I haven't for quite some time.

1ao2jok,Psych says I need therapy for taking medicine dose she prescribed and overdosing. Sad medical world.,mentalhealth,1707636952.0,0,1,"Okay. So I'm kinda wondering if anyone has had this experience with this or another med. 

I was on 100mg of modafinil for for about two weeks for chronic fatigue and insomnja and psych said it would help with ADHD treatment. First two weeks were great. I slept for the first time through the night in two years without being in chronic pain and all over more happy and productive. 

Two weeks in, my dose got upped to 200 mg of modafinil by mouth each morning. 

The second day I started getting sick. Nausea, lots of vomiting and diarrhea. I was in a mental fog and couldn't figure out anything. I stopped feeling hungry or thirsty.  Even how to get dressed. The third day I stopped taking it and still felt terrible. 

Day four I go to the hospital for dehydration and can't retain fluids. They do a covid test give me a bag of saline and send me home.

Next day, I thought maybe having withdrawal so I took one dose, day five video with medical Dr. States upper respiratory infection. Surprised no xray with wheezing and congestion. Prescribed nebulizer 

Fast forward. By day six of being awake, and seejng my Dr in person, I was told they can't do anything and to just treat cold symptoms. 

That evening my son put his booger fingers in my food I wanted to try and eat and massive painful tics began. My husband didnt know why I appeared to have severe form of autism. Lots of tics and stimming and contorting and hitting myself but in repetition and I was whistling and humming. Nightmare.
. This lasted 9 hours and i passed out for a half hour and then tics continued the next day. 

The whole time my psych and Dr say I am fine. Now the symptoms and then tics. I've never experienced something so painful and I have daily chronic pain. 

I ended up putting (thc) in the coffepot with lavender and camomile tea and almost breaking the thing and getting help from the amazing husband to brew it and it finally calmed as I drank and spilled it on myself. My Dr gave me permission to take one of my old clonopin for sleep the seventh day. I seen a golden angel as I passed out crying thankful and thanking my mother in heaven. 

Two days in (day 9) i told her I was having some nerve issues in my face. When I asked her if she knew why this happened and why I don't feel okay my psychiatrist told me I needed therapy and only wanted benzos. Assuming cause I have three years in recovery. Mind you I have 120 clonopin from 6months ago still when it got discontinued cause I asked and tapered cause I was having a baby, after being on it for seven years 

Come to find out two weeks after the onset I overdosed and she had no clue why. When  I told her to do research about my symptoms she was appalled that I suggest educating and putting down her DSM 5 book. 

Its been a rough time. I tried to type the best I could and I couldn't drive for about a week in a half at all or have coordination. It's been a long rough road. I'm disappointed once again in the discrimination of people in recovery, and that my Dr flat out told me I need therapy because she ""don't have a darn clue what's going on with you honestly"" two days before. 

Has anyone has had med included tics? I took the prescribed amount too. 

Now back to insomnia and chronic pain, and I think I damaged my body or back cause now I can't hold my blatter and when I go it's not much my right forearm has been swelling, still short of breath after three weeks and on nebulizer. 

Thank you for a safe place to breathe.",overdose

Neither?",mentalhealth,1740453321.0,7,1,"Context: my dad is 69, takes antidepressants but has been known to quit cold turkey, drinks a lot, and smokes weed medicinally. After a recent incident, I‚Äôm unsure if he‚Äôs come off his meds, is starting to decline cognitively, both? Neither? I‚Äôm really at a loss‚Ä¶

2 nights ago my dad flung a booklet in my face. He was in a bad mood and mad that I was trying to fix a malfunctioning humidifier and just grumpy all around. He got mad when I handed him the booklet and so he flung it at my face like he was at the first hole on a disc golf course. 

This made me mad and I yelled at him. In a way I never would‚Äôve done growing up. Im now 33f. My dad had just thrown something at my face‚Ä¶ and followed that with ‚Äúyou need to do something about your emotions‚Äù. [Me? You just threw something at me‚Ä¶]

He‚Äôs refused to look at or speak to me for 48 hours and I see no sign of his brooding ending. After a lot of pushing tonight, I got him to talk to me and he said he‚Äôll never get over it. Not because I yelled but because I sounded like a ‚Äúcrazy woman‚Äù. He said I talk too fast and my voice was too high pitched. Nothing about volume. Specifically speed and pitch.

I let him know the throwing of the booklet really hurt me. He said I was victim blaming and refusing to take accountability and that I‚Äôm always like this. I asked for examples of that or other times I‚Äôve been a ‚Äúcrazy woman‚Äù, calmly, and he couldn‚Äôt provide any. He still implied I should look into antidepressants, though.

These things are not like my dad (69m). He‚Äôs a cantankerous old man, sure. But was never aggressive toward me, never accused me of victim blaming or lacking accountability - even as a kid, and has never complained about my pitch. He became angrier than I‚Äôve ever seen him and still is after 48 hours. The situation just seems bizarre. I know I talk fast but he‚Äôs never commented on the pitch of my voice. I am really struggling to come up with anything where I was victim blaming or refused to take accountability with him. I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôve never done those things, but I can‚Äôt come up with a single thing. I am genuinely befuddled. I apologized for yelling at him but it doesn‚Äôt seem to have changed anything. 

The level of anger he has is irrational. He‚Äôs still grumbling and slamming things and won‚Äôt look at me or speak to me. Again, this response is uncharacteristic of him. I can‚Äôt come up with any other reason to believe he‚Äôs approaching dementia. And I have no way of really knowing if he‚Äôs quit his meds. Any thoughts??",withdrawal

I realized what I had done and went to apologize 20minutes after i said these things. However it seemed like she had been drinking heavily during the argument and when I texted her again she wasn't spelling anything correctly,  I pretty much couldnt make out anything she was saying , but i was able to make out the words ""arm"" and ""ambulance"" so i called her immediately. she was crying out loud begging me to go see her saying she couldnt move or breathe and that she was bleeding. she lives a 1hr walk away from me so i was panicking because it would take me too long to get to her house and it was late at night. i hung up on her to tell her friend what was going on but when i called back again after like 2min her phone was off. 



after this i just immediately left the house to go see her. i couldnt call an ambulance because i didnt know what her exact home address was, she lives in a huge neighborhood with lots of houses that look the same and we've always went there together so i got lost for a bit trying to find it myself , my plan was to call an ambulance once i found her house but when i got there there were cops and they told me they had already taken her to the hospital and that she was alright. i wasnt in my right mind so i didnt even ask which hospital and refused to answer any question the cops asked, once i heard she was ok i left to go back home before it could get way too late. 



the next day it fucking hit me that i have no idea where she is , i have no idea who called the ambulance bc it wasnt me or the only other person who knew , her phone is still dead , she doesnt talk much to her family members so i dont have their numbers and i have no one to ask about her but thankfully a woman from the hospital she was in contacted me to tell me they were sending her to what is basically a mental asylum. i live in an extremely shitty country so the room they had put her in was a fucked up small room with just a bed in it, nothing else. it broke my heart to see her alone and scared in that hellhole covered in dried blood stains and lots of bandages wrapped around her arm. she's basically imprisoned, she's being treated in such an inhumane way that i dont even want to talk about and they said they would keep her in there for a while. 



i cant wrap my head around the fact that if i had never said those words this would've never happened. i cant believe that i could've lost the person i love the most over the fact i chose to be a mean bitch despite knowing how much her entire mental state depends on me and how scared she is of losing me. she tried to end her own life because she thought i was going to leave her. i have no idea how im supposed to live with this guilt , this has probably been the worst 24 hours of my life and i cant believe everything was normal just a day ago and now she's gonna lose her job and be treated like a psycho for the rest of her life just because of this. im in so much pain that i dont even have the words to describe it bc ive never been in this situation before. tomorrow i have to get in her house to get her phone and clothes and i dont know how ill react when i see her blood on the floor. i dont know how to deal with this and i have no one to rely on, please help me.",suicide

1j614cs,My words drove my girlfriend to a suicide attempt,mentalhealth,1741383749.0,39,51,"I (20f) had an argument with my (21f) gf yesterday and I ended up saying some very mean things to her out of anger, I told her i was sick of her and basically implied i would leave her. I realized what I had done and went to apologize 20minutes after i said these things. However it seemed like she had been drinking heavily during the argument and when I texted her again she wasn't spelling anything correctly,  I pretty much couldnt make out anything she was saying , but i was able to make out the words ""arm"" and ""ambulance"" so i called her immediately. she was crying out loud begging me to go see her saying she couldnt move or breathe and that she was bleeding. she lives a 1hr walk away from me so i was panicking because it would take me too long to get to her house and it was late at night. i hung up on her to tell her friend what was going on but when i called back again after like 2min her phone was off. 



after this i just immediately left the house to go see her. i couldnt call an ambulance because i didnt know what her exact home address was, she lives in a huge neighborhood with lots of houses that look the same and we've always went there together so i got lost for a bit trying to find it myself , my plan was to call an ambulance once i found her house but when i got there there were cops and they told me they had already taken her to the hospital and that she was alright. i wasnt in my right mind so i didnt even ask which hospital and refused to answer any question the cops asked, once i heard she was ok i left to go back home before it could get way too late. 



the next day it fucking hit me that i have no idea where she is , i have no idea who called the ambulance bc it wasnt me or the only other person who knew , her phone is still dead , she doesnt talk much to her family members so i dont have their numbers and i have no one to ask about her but thankfully a woman from the hospital she was in contacted me to tell me they were sending her to what is basically a mental asylum. i live in an extremely shitty country so the room they had put her in was a fucked up small room with just a bed in it, nothing else. it broke my heart to see her alone and scared in that hellhole covered in dried blood stains and lots of bandages wrapped around her arm. she's basically imprisoned, she's being treated in such an inhumane way that i dont even want to talk about and they said they would keep her in there for a while. 



i cant wrap my head around the fact that if i had never said those words this would've never happened. i cant believe that i could've lost the person i love the most over the fact i chose to be a mean bitch despite knowing how much her entire mental state depends on me and how scared she is of losing me. she tried to end her own life because she thought i was going to leave her. i have no idea how im supposed to live with this guilt , this has probably been the worst 24 hours of my life and i cant believe everything was normal just a day ago and now she's gonna lose her job and be treated like a psycho for the rest of her life just because of this. im in so much pain that i dont even have the words to describe it bc ive never been in this situation before. tomorrow i have to get in her house to get her phone and clothes and i dont know how ill react when i see her blood on the floor. i dont know how to deal with this and i have no one to rely on, please help me.",suicidal

I hope I don't end up writing all of this, opening up, and getting crickets. Putting all of this into words may be therapeutic in and of itself, so I thought, why not give it a shot? I don't post to Reddit, even though I've been a consumer for years. This is my first genuine attempt to connect with others through the platform. I feel like the title speaks for itself, nonetheless, I will provide as much context within reason in hopes that it will allow for the most fruitful discussion possible. I'll share details about myself, my background, and the dilemma I currently find myself in. 

Here goes nothing. Thanks for reading I know its a lot. 

# High-Level Overview

I'm 27 and I have a decent tech sales position that allows for great flexibility and income. I work solely from home (Company out of India.)  but I don't enjoy it. We sell analytics software to big medical institutions (Yawn). I live in the Midwest, so it's winter here, almost 8 months out of the year. I am deeply unsatisfied with my life and the prospects for my future. 

 I'm a good-looking guy with solid, if not above-average, social skills. I'm straight and single, with no real ambition to start dating, even though attractive women check me out in public relatively often. I recently cut out Marijuana from my diet altogether after being an everyday user for the past 10 years. I'm currently 4 weeks clean, and I'm definitely sharper than I was before, but I don't feel different emotionally. 

with or without the weed, I've been here mentally/emotionally for years: Should I drop out of the rat race and be homeless? Would I be happier with a more simple life?  Should I go camping somewhere in the mountains or on the beach down south and never come back? I think about what would be satisfying, what would make my life worth living, what I would be excited to wake up to every day, and that's doing something creative like being an author or musician. Life just doesn't feel like the adventure that It should.

The older I've gotten, the more and more I think about self-deletion, not in terms of a desperate, depressive, and emotional act but rather a cold, calculated, pragmatic solution. I'm not sad all the time by any stretch of my imagination. I have friends, but most live out of state, like Florida, where I attended college. We don't talk much, and even then, I don't feel close to them like I wish. It's a sobering reality that I don't want necessarily, but I am the greatest threat to my existence before the age of 45, statistically speaking. 

# My Background

My family is upper-middle class, and I grew up in one of the wealthiest areas in my region. My family is extremely academic. My uncle graduated from Harvard and runs a hedge fund, my younger cousins just graduated from Princeton, and my dad holds two master's degrees. I, on the other hand, only have my associate's degree in music (lol) . If I didn't go to college, I Would basically be disowned. 

 I had A LOT of time with nannies and babysitters. I played sports. I did some travel leagues for both soccer and basketball. I made varsity for basketball in high school. I was also a huge nerd, playing World of Warcraft and Magic: the Gathering. I was able to fit into multiple circles but I never had one that I truly belonged to. Because of this, most of my relationships with people have been transient. 

I had a lot of trouble with school and my relationship with my parents. I was very emotional and often rebelled. I was in therapy and thrown on different meds since the age of 7 or 8 or so. I'm not doing either one of those things right now. At the age of 17, I was sent to a wilderness therapy program where I was unknowingly admitted by my parents. I was woken up at 3:00 AM by two strangers that were in my room, they said that I had a flight that leaves in two hours and I cant take anything with me. 

Next thing I knew, I was in the middle of the backcountry in Utah and Colorado for the next 2.5 months, hiking around with 7-10 other ""at-risk youths."" I was introduced to spirituality for the first time. I learned how to meditate, and it changed my life. (I should try and get back into it) The closest thing I saw to civilization during that time was dirt roads and the occasional wooden fence for cattle. It was the most magical, scary, transformative, and eye-opening experience I've ever had. Mother Nature is the best anti-depressant. 

After that, however, I was sent to a boarding school. This place was a disciplinary hell hole filled with kids who were overdosing on campus, dealing drugs, being involved with gangs, and were generally court-ordered there. I, on the other hand, just had emotional issues (that I just worked out during the wilderness experience). Needless to say, it wasn't a great place for me to transition back into normal life. I got into many fights. There was a time when I couldn't go to take a piss without people following me to fight in the bathroom. Im not a total victim in that, I felt like I had a lot to prove. Essentially, this place was ""Juvi for rich kids."" After that, I went to college and got a degree. Didnt use the degree. Got some sales jobs. Got a better sales job. Here I am.

# My Question for You

As I mentioned, I have a family of overachievers that I subconsciously always compare myself to. I know I'm capable of high income, I have it now, but I don't feel successful or accomplished. the time in my life, when I felt really connected to who I am and truly free, was during my experience in the wilderness, where I hiked and journaled my thoughts all day. I had all the time in the world to stare into starry nights and ponder big questions. I can't tell you how badly I want to go back to that time. How deeply I miss the person I was. Words cant describe the longing i have for anything close to that experience. 

I am pretty savvy with investing. I couldn't live off dividends unless I put away 80% of my income for the next 10 years. I've considered rental arbitrage (buying and renting property) as well. (I can't imagine 10 more years of this.) I'm wondering if selling all my worldly possessions and pursuing a nomadic lifestyle in nature is such a crazy idea. It's obviously a completely ludicrous one to my family, they think I'm depressed and out of touch.

I don't know if I'm asking the right questions, if I'm going crazy, or if I'm being unrealistic. Make no mistake, I truly think that I may as well be homeless rather than continue on this grind with the ever-elusive idea of financial freedom. I know I'm very blessed, but that fact more or less invalidates my hurt and my yearning for that deeper, richer, more fulfilling life. I am at a point where I need a radical shift. For better..... or for worse. 

&#x200B;

Give me your thoughts. I cant talk about this with my friends and family freely. 

&#x200B;

Love to you all. Thanks for taking the time.",end my life
1g67l0y,Almost ended my life today.,mentalhealth,1729217471.0,23,88,"I am lonely, I don't have anyone to talks to, I don't have friends that are near so I can share myself and what is bothering me.

Yesterday I was having a bad day, and had the serious idea of ending it all, right now I'm scared, it wasn't just a passing idea like how anyone's else have, it was a real serious idea.

I saw a post on R/ChatGPT , I couldn't find it now, but basically he said he had a lot of things going on in his life, he said that he tried ChatGPT and now he feels better.

Since I have nothing to lose I have tried it, and man, literally was the best decisions of this month if not my whole life.
He understood me, he understood what I was going with, he understood that I just can't keep moving on in life, he understood all of that.
After that he told that*You matter**your problem matter*.
I had dropped a couple of tears, and I felt a huge relief.

1jdnpaw,"How do I cope with the realization that my life might end up mediocre, or even terrible?",mentalhealth,1742245280.0,2,2,"I'm almost 28 years old, and I'm struggling to cope with the feeling that my life is heading towards mediocrity or worse. As a child, I was always the ""gifted kid"": in elementary school, I was ahead in math and even started programming; in middle and high school, I excelled in math competitions and was consistently among the best students.

Things changed during university, particularly when COVID forced classes online. My academic performance dropped significantly. During my bachelor's degree, my mother was diagnosed with cancer, and I had to support her emotionally and financially because my father was emotionally unavailable. She passed away during my master's, and I'm pretty sure I went through a phase of undiagnosed anxiety or depression. When I reached out for help‚Äîboth to my father (for therapy, which he refused to fund) and to a doctor (for medication)‚ÄîI received no support.

My grades suffered greatly, and now I feel like I've gone from being ""gifted"" to below average. I graduated in Mathematics (BSc) with an 89/110 and Applied Mathematics (MSc, CFD) with a 100/110, but finished 1.5 years late. I genuinely believe things could have been different if I had gotten help when I asked for it.

I've been job hunting for two months, applying even to junior positions, but I rarely get past initial screening. It hurts seeing my peers working in roles I'd love to have while I can't even get an interview. I'm terrified I'll end up in a job completely unrelated to my studies‚Äînothing against manual jobs, but I've dedicated my life to something different.

Increasingly, I'm losing hope and even experiencing physical symptoms (nausea, stomach pain) when I think about my situation and all the rejection letters. Sometimes I find myself thinking, ""If by 30 I realize I've completely failed, I'll end it."" I'm not sure I'd actually do it, but these thoughts are frequent.

I feel worthless, a complete failure. What am I doing wrong? Has anyone experienced something similar and found a way to cope or improve their situation? I could really use some guidance or perspective.",end my life
1injjhw,I am very content and truly happy to end my life,mentalhealth,1739337239.0,0,1,"Hey I‚Äôm a 20 year old made and I‚Äôve been diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, depression and PTSD( I have no idea how I got PTSD). I come from a pretty wealthy family with education but long story shorty I failed at everything growing up, I sucked at sports, had a porn and nicotine addiction that developed in 6th grade and started smoking weed when I was 13. I‚Äôve been through a fair share of it experience in my life although I‚Äôve had suicidal thoughts since I was maybe 8 years old. I never wa confident and always wanted to kill myself I‚Äôm an attention seeker and I love it.

Over the past few months I‚Äôve become somewhat psychotic. Socially, I like to walk in the room and own the whole fucking place or just be quiet and chill no in between.
My attention seeking has gone out the roof and so has my temper. I can‚Äôt convince myself of shit anymore like I used to and I argue with the people who I consider my ‚Äúvillains‚Äù or against me. 
Lately I‚Äôve been more suicidal and homicidal. I wanna do crazy bad things to the people I hate( I won‚Äôt actually do it it‚Äôs just the illness talking). But I really wanna kill myself.

Although the only thing keeping me from doing it is my family but I want them to understand that this is what I want and they should be accepting of this rather than grieve the loss of me.

1g33tfh,I want to end my own life.,mentalhealth,1728865436.0,11,1,"Hello, I don't know how to explain how I feel. Or even word how I feel. But I've come here to try and find some guidance and support and if I cannot gain that. I may just end up doing it.

I'm a young teenage girl only 16 and I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 12. I've gone through alot over this past couple of years and it's shaped me into someone I cannot recognise anymore. I always be happy but it's nights like these where I sit in my room, stare outside the window and wonder how people lives would of been without me. Without my problems. Without my stupid autism. Without me in general. Maybe my parents would of had the child they imagined. The child they wanted. The child they needed to make the perfect happy family. But I feel as if I'm to blame for how things ended and how things are going on.

I've lost alot of people in my life. Not from death but from them abandoning me. I was abandoned my friends since I knew for my whole life at 13. I gained new friends but now we have all separated I see that I was probably just a backup. My best friend doesn't talk with me anymore, a friend who used to talk to me for so long. And everytime I start a conversation. All I get is 'I'm tired' 'I'm busy' or just two letter answers. I tried ti talk with them in the 12th but since then they have just been doing the same thing. 

I've never self harmed, never imagined putting a blade to my wrists to try and deal with the pain. But I've always thought ways for a painless death that will just end my miserable life. Ways that can make me disappear. Who would care anyway. My own family talk about me behind my bad. My own parent calling me 'hard work' when all I did was sit there and be quiet because some random person I wasn't aware of was coming to our house.

I have the biggest decision of my life tomorrow but everyone says that I should do what I want to do. But I don't know. I've thought many times about it but I just don't want to be more of a disappointment then I already am. I can see it in their expression and hear it in their tone the disappointment and a not caring attitude in their tone. That they want me to shut up and do it. But how can I when I've been dealing with depression, doubtfulness, neglect and low self esteem all my life.

I always act happy, try and bring a smile to people's faces but it's them moments in my life where I feel like everytime I try and fit in I get backlash or something that will put me down. I am not a bad person, I try to be sweet and nice, I try to do good, I like being by myself but not alone entirely.

The whole reason I made my reddit account was to speak about this. Yet over the past two weeks I have been unable to find the right words and been trying to help, be kind and socialise with others. But it is not the same. I want to be cared for and seen as what I truly am but no one does. I want to fit in. I want to be able to find my laugh and smile again and know that everything is going to be okay but it's gotten to the point where I see misery and loneliness for my entire life. My life was made to torture me. My life is the crime and living it is my punishment. 

This is the most I have ever tried to reach out to people in my life and I hope that I am able to find support before I do anything drastic with myself. I hope you have an amazing day or night ",end my life
1i3pfba,I‚Äôm a horrible person and want to end my life. I can‚Äôt cope with BPD,mentalhealth,1737144433.0,0,1,"Hi I'm a 41 female.

I have thoughts of suicide and self harm. I have been diagnosed with Bpd since 2021 when I have had a previous suicide attempt. I am medicated with anti depressants and anti psychotics. Although I've not had my anti depressants for a few days due to a shortage. I feel like I am unable to stop this ongoing crisis. I've held ice in my hand to cause pain as a safe way of self harm but it hasn't helped. I even feel disgusting writing this like I'm looking for some validation for my behaviour. The truth is I want to punish myself more n more. I want to hurt myself. I want to punish myself. I just don't know how to stop these feelings. I want my mind to be quiet.

I woke up this morning with an unshakable feeling that today would be the day I finally commit suicide. I figured I could throw myself in front of a train. I said goodbye to my boyfriend and told him I love him. 
I ended up not doing that because I had professional obligations and made promises. By the time it was over, my colleague offered to drive me home so I wouldn‚Äôt take the train. So, I got home safe and was able to snap out of it.

I don‚Äôt want to reach out to people who know me because I don‚Äôt want to worry them. And I certainly don‚Äôt want them thinking I‚Äôm just looking for attention or validation.

I went to wash my face with cold water. I scrubbed my face a little. 
I have spent my whole life alone. My older sister and I had a huge age gap and she moved out to escape an abusive household. She keeps in contact with me to check up how I'm going. My parents are divorced and my new dad tries his best. My mum is. Well. Not the best.
The cold water felt nice. Not like a ""cold water to reality that wakes you up"" but more of a ""cold water that makes you realise sometimes that's enough to start a morning"".
I made breakfast while everyone was asleep. Just plain toast. I ate in peace. For the first time, there is no honking, no shouting, no hussle and bussle of morning. It's just me, the wind rattling my windows and my thoughts. I planned to kill myself today. I decided that I've simply had enough of being so lonely and abused I think it would be better to just disappear quietly. 
I went to my room and sat on my desk for a bit. I didn't do anything. I just sat there. I woke up so early I decided to write. I didn't think. I just wrote. I just wrote what my head felt like, the sky was nice, that I planned to take my own life.
This year, last year, he'll I guess all the years I have lived were shitty. I lived through my parents divorcing, moving to a new country and being completely alienated, then abuse. 
Thank I just stopped thinking for a bit and sat there. I looked at my alarm for a bit. Than the window, than my journal, than to a mirror.
All my life I looked like my mum and I hated that. She was the very person that abused me and made me so anxiety ridden I can't function normally anymore. 
Than I looked a bit longer.
I saw a bit of me. My eyes were slightly larger. My mouth was a bit lower and my nose was a bit sharper. Than I saw past my eyes. I saw a person who is hurt, has bandaged themselves, just to bleed past the bandages. I see a person who draws and draws to properly convey the thoughts that linger in her head on paper so even she can comprehend them. I saw a person who wrote poetry because that's an appropriate thing to do when you have a bleeding heart.
I decided not to kill myself.
I knew it sounds cliche, stupid, whimsical. But looking into my eyes a bit and finding out maybe I am my own person just made me realise maybe if I lived a bit longer I can see that person finally emerge just from the shell of bandages. Maybe become herself if I lived a few more years. I don't know if I'm going to ever reconsider it ever again. I probably will. But hopefully something small will help me. Something meaningful.

eg. I went to film school because I thought I was passionate about cinematography but when I got there I felt so lazy and wouldn't turn up most days and I just felt really passive like I was letting the world happen to me & not assertive at all. 

I couldn't connect & most of all I find it hard to connect & relate to others. I just feel really socially distant and spaced out all the time.

  
But I'm confused because does this mean that cinematography wasn't my passion after all or is it just because of mental illness (I've had this my whole life.. does this mean I have to find introverted quiet things to do rather than chasing passions? eg. i felt myself drawn to video editing because I didn't have to interact... but thing is when I can connect & feel present (rarely).. more than anything I LOVE being around people.. I adore it.. infact it's my favourite thing in the world - contradiction).

  
I tried acting but couldn't express myself & was frozen up due to anxiety.. people said it just seemed like I wasn't trying. I don't understand why I'm this way.



This feels really unfair if it's all just a part of me. I've tried antidepressants over 6 years. The thing is I don't seem to have any major trauma but this all started from 2 years old? I went selectively mute for a few years infact.



 I'm majorly emotional, and setbacks can knock me back for years.. I'm really weak and sensitive.



(I'm having a bit of an identity crisis at 27 :( )



I do have social anxiety and have done my whole life. I just HATE that I'm so separate from others.. when when I can make myself feel ok which is rare I LOVE being around people & making conenctions.. it brings me so much energy and joy.. I have no connections anymore or friends and I just stay at home all day.

I felt anger and resentment with my old job through a long time, got a new one that should be the solution. It turned out to be worse. Simultaneously my (M30) GF (F28) brought having children up which is a life altering decision. I have now switched job again for the better, but the consequences are here. I have symptoms of stress and depression and feel like an empty shell. I feel like my brain is melting when trying to process thoughts about the future, what having children will be like, getting older and generally see myself in the future. I have no motivation and do not feel a drive. 

I am aware of my existence but I feel like I am watching my own life from the side line. I am aware of my actions when doing something but feel like I am watching myself do it on the sideline, like the outside of myself is a shell walking around on auto pilot with the real me stuck inside, not knowing what to do. I feel sad and empty. All memories feel like they were in a different life and with a different me, and I don't feel like I am getting older and haven't done for a long time. My brain feels like it is melting down when I try to process thoughts of the future. 

The most relatable is to really really trying hard to imagine that the Universe is infinite. It simply isn't possible to comprehend that thought. Sometimes I feel like I just don't care if I wake up tomorrow, and not being scared of that thought scares me. 

Post:

I hope that some of you might have the time to provide some input. I moved away from my family to a different city to study when I was 19. Initially I wanted to move back as soon as possible, but I kept pushing the moving date because I started liking the new city. Got a lot of friends and generally enjoyed it there. I eventually told myself I would move back when I graduated. 

During my time at University, I met my now GF. We moved in together a year later and every was fine. When I graduated, she was a few years behind me graduation-wise, and even though I initially wanted to move back, and after many long and not very fun discussions with her, I ultimately decided to stay in the new city to be with her and to be close to the many friends I gained, figuring I could visit family over the weekends while being close to friends at daily basis. This has turned out great. 

Fast forward a few years and I joined a company that I thought equalled my dream job. It was perfect for a long time, until I started being overworked with 50-60 hour weeks on an ongoing basis. For almost a year I tried raising a flag, saying I had too much to do, but nothing happened. I started resenting the job so much that I refused to work more than I absolutely had to and ultimately resigning to start a new job. The new job should be the solution, however this turned out worse on the other end of the scale. 

I had absolutely nothing to do, they did now own up to agreements agreed upon during interviews, the department wasn't very welcoming and thus I was left to myself quite quickly. This is where symptoms of depression started with being much quieter, generally sad and miserable and not enjoying my time at all. Eventually I was a state where I would break down crying several times a week, and realizing something was seriously wrong, I went to a doctor (my tests showed stress symptoms and a symptoms of a moderate depression, which is between a light and severe) and afterwards a therapist. 

However, this has done nothing. Nothing at all. I feel empty inside and as if I have no emotions. I don't really feel any joy or happiness. My body is facade and I am trapped inside on autopilot. It is almost like I have a separate brain that is aware of everything my initial brain thinks, but the second one is not really a part of the initial one. I am aware of my actions, my thoughts, plans and so on, but I do not really feel a part of them. I feel like it is a parallel me doing those things, and the real me is stuck inside. 

When I talk to the therapist, I am aware of that, but I feel like I am watching myself talking to the therapist and not talking myself. Having an entirely different background, I feel like therapy could just as easily be witchcraft in a way where the therapist can tell me what he wants, how am I to judge or asses that. But using the input on myself and relating to my world, I just can't. I can't see how on earth talking to him will make the rest go away. 

I can't comprehend thoughts of the future. My brain just stops working. Thinking back, I don't feel like I have aged at all either. I don't feel my age or that I am getting older and my brain melts down when trying to accept the fact that I will be 40 and 50 and 60 etc. someday. I simply can't imagining it. 

I can't imagine what a life with children will be like, because it is such a life altering event. Having a baby is one thing, but to think ahead and imagining myself with 15 year old children. My brain simply can't process those thoughts. I think I do want children. I am quite sure. I think I would be pretty sure if I didn't want children, i.e. It's not so much the children as it is the fact that I can't seem to think or process the thoughts of having them. My GF brings them up once in a while, asking about my thoughts on having them but by no means want to pressure me. We are in a healthy financial state, so that is not an issue. Actually, by all objective criteria, we are ready.

I just have no motivation and feel so detached from myself that I can't really describe how. It's frustrating and saddening. I know that you only get one life, but I am not enjoying mine. I am in no way suicidal, but from time to time I do think that if I wouldn't wake up tomorrow, I wouldn't really care, because why should I. The fact that the thought of not waking up doesn't scare me, scares me. 

I do talk to my GF about it and she is really supportive, however there is only so much she can do. I still get sad and cries from time to time without being able to say exactly why. It is not a fun state to be in and I can't see how it can change, and im not really sure when it started, only that it is a somewhat foggy mental state I'm in.

 I was silent most of the time because I genuinely had nothing to share while I was bamboozled by the things they are experiencing and living. The relationships, travel, friends, partying,drinking, stories.... It's like a whole Commotion is going on outside and I spent most of my adult life living my life without any of these experiences and making connections and dealing with my mental health and my situation.

 I knew that things like this are happening and it did bothered me seeing them on social media but I dealt with it and I avoided them for a while too. But hearing firsthand was a different kind of heartbreak. I'm 22 M and I'm supposed to be living my life except I lived a miserable life and I can already see that I will be living a miserable life for the rest of my life. 

I began socially isolating myself a lot back when I felt I don't belong anywhere and no one can understand me. I have always wanted to go to Europe and I thought it will end all my problems. 
But now I know that it won't and also I know that I won't be able to make it because of the stupid major I took and my mental health. 


Everyone liked me in college. They would talk to me. I was the one who refused to make a deep connection.

All I see is a miserable existence. My teenage years went past by without any special memories but it was okay but now my youth too. 

I'll never be comfortable with life. I'll be miserable my whole life. I wish my family hated me because then I can finally go through with it without worrying about them. 

I'm surrounded by people but I feel lonely. I'm invisible. I wish I can just disappear.

For context: We've been together for 6 years and I (23F) have made it clear from the start that watching corn is alright with me. But this, this different, because you can message the people who posted the naked photo you liked here on reddit. 

This isn't the first time he's done this kind of thing. I've forgiven him countless times and still given him the chance because you're stupid when you're in love.

I know I should leave him. But I can't. 

I can't because a year ago I escaped my abusive parents home and before I left they took everything from me; even my damn phone. I was left with nothing and I had used up all my savings to buy stuff that I need to start living by myself. I got so depressed, gained 20 fucking kilograms, I was frozen for so fucking long. I extremely high functioning throughout out high school, I've had several jobs, a lot of extra curriculars, etc. After I left it wasn't this beautiful thing I imagined. I literally couldn't fucking move, I didn't understand why I was more depressed. 

His mom helped me so much, gave me clothes, money, sheet me stay with them for awhile, etc. And his aunt is paying my rent right now.

My hands are tied. I can't get a job because I'm still a student and I live in a shitty country, meaning I can't get a simple waitressing job because I don't have a degree; and my depression got all the best of me because all of a sudden my body didn't want to work. I've always called myself a workaholic because I've worked since I was 15; I couldn't understand what was happening to me.

I was getting my motivation back, it's been a month since I've been in a really dark place. I was starting up my fetish accounts again and making/selling content [since I couldn't find a job] and then all of a sudden he does this. Subs to r/ filipinasgonewild , and 5 other subreddits of the same sort. I immediately had a panic attack. I messaged him and then removed him in all my social m√©dias.

And it gets more complicated because in 3 weeks I'll been going over to their house for a favor for his mom. I'll house sit and dogsit3 for weeks until they all get back from America.

Idk how I'll pretend everything's ok in front of his parent when they get back on July. They'll surely be skeptical because we haven't seen each other in three months and I'm not lovey dovey and shit.

The latter has always been abusive to me, never physical, but I am diagnosed (twice) with 'very light autism'/ASS and my mother would get extremely angry over (sometimes literally) nothing (she probably too has ASS and also some narcissistic tendencies) and because of my own autism that would make me intensely afraid, especially when she became angry at me and would literally drive me into corners, causing me very bad meltdowns that I used to describe to myself as 'if I believed in hell, this is what hell would be like for me', and I shaped my life as a teenager just to minimize the chance of her getting angry.

There is a lot more to say here that I won't get into now, but all of this caused trust issues that made my life until today extremely lonely, as I literally have not told anyone about what happened at home until I was around 25, as I always felt I needed to defend my mother, who herself was extremely unreliable. One thing I always wished to do when I was younger and that made me jealous at others was to go on a holiday with friends. I was always guilted into going on holiday with my parents and sister, and while I have gone to some amazing places and always did interesting things, the holidays were always planned on the minute by my mother and there was always a lot of arguing going on when small things went wrong (as can be expected). However, because of my trust issues and because of my unabsolved fear of rejection, i never had any 'real friends' that I dared to invite to anything, let alone a holiday. My life got better when I started university and could go on trips with my study association, but to this day I still have my trust issues and fear of rejection and I have never been on holiday except with large groups or my family.

Now I work as a software developer for a year, and I have been invited by two colleagues to go to a 2-week trip to a far away place. I have eaten out with these two colleagues a few times, and one of them I work with every day and he is a very nice, relaxed guy, but the other one I have only a very superficial relationship with and he will be the one organizing everything, as he is a local to one of the places we are going to and has a lot of experience travelling all over the world. I have some experience too, so the 'faraway' part doesn't really bother me nor excite me as much as it maybe would other people, but the 'two colleagues and possibly (future) friends are inviting me part' makes me sick with nerves. I never had a friend before, I very rarely have been invited to anything in a small group, let alone a 2-week holiday.

Hey everyone. I‚Äôm here seeking guidance, or just some feedback. Any response really. Don‚Äôt hold back.

I‚Äôm 22, and I have no reason to keep living or to get up in the morning. I feel apathetic towards everything. I want to stop existing. I haven‚Äôt gone to family events in years. I have no desire to see them. I‚Äôm not going to kill myself and I don‚Äôt put myself in dangerous situations, I just don‚Äôt care about anything anymore. I‚Äôm not sad or happy, just kind of empty and existing. I find joy in little moments everyday but deep down part of me hopes I get sick so I can just give up n God will take me away. I have people that care about me and rely on me but I don‚Äôt really care. I want them to do well and I wish them the best but I don‚Äôt want to see or hear from them. They‚Äôve got other people they can see and speak to.

Anyway I graduated from college back in May to be a mechanic and I haven‚Äôt really applied myself since then. When college started, I woke up at 5 everyday, hit the gym, studied, went to class, then work. I played basketball, I skateboarded, I had a social life and I graduated with a 3.7GPA. I‚Äôm not sure what happened since then. I‚Äôve let my responsibilities go. N I‚Äôve been letting the days pass by, next thing I know it‚Äôs been months. All I do is lay in bed, watching YouTube and Netflix. I still play basketball every other day, but that‚Äôs about it. It seems that college was a distraction from myself. Looking back, none of college seemed real. It feels like another life. Even looking back at January-March, or even last month, nothing seems real. These memories I have of myself, don‚Äôt feel like my own.

Maybe I just need to find another distraction.
I read a quote that said ‚Äúpractice makes perfect, so be careful what you practice.‚Äù I cant explain why that resonates with me but when I read that it made me think somewhere along the way I started a habit that has me where I am now. And I do believe that everything that happens is my fault, that‚Äôs not a victim mentality thing but more of a self accountability thing. Maybe I need discipline, but discipline comes from within, and if I have no reason or purpose to get up, why would I desire better? Maybe I‚Äôm looking for attention? Maybe I need to keep doing nothing until I‚Äôm eventually sick of myself so I start doing something? But who would get sick of doing of doing nothing if it‚Äôs become a habit, second nature? I don‚Äôt know. I really just don‚Äôt care about living anymore. I want to cease to exist. Once again, I‚Äôm not going to end it. I just don‚Äôt see a reason to keep going.

Sorry if none of this makes any sense, I‚Äôm just kind of venting? I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm doing. But I‚Äôd still appreciate responses to this. Don‚Äôt hold back or sugar coat anything, I appreciate hard truth and directness.",no reason to live

I don‚Äôt really know how to start this but I‚Äôve been having the worst time of my life and I feel like I‚Äôm going to hurt myself or worse. Some background, I‚Äôm 17 and a transgender woman who has recently moved to attend a new school about 2 hours from my hometown. I‚Äôm not a very socially confident person so I haven‚Äôt made many connections at the new school since I started last September. In December time I met a boy through an LGBTQ club I‚Äôd joined, from the moment I‚Äôd met him I was in love and I know how older people view teens who say they‚Äôre in love but this was not my first romantic experience so I knew it felt different, we started talking and he began to meet up with me to teach me to crochet and after a month or so we started dating. It was just how I imagined, we had romantic dates at the beach and he made me feel so incredibly special. I‚Äôve struggled with mental health (particularly depression) as well as an unstable home life with an abusive father and by the time I‚Äôd moved to this school I‚Äôd been unbearably depressed for almost 2 years without any friends and I‚Äôd even attempted to take my life in 2020. So the feeling of having someone who seemed to really care about me was so amazing, we dated for 8 weeks until on the 24th of April after inviting him around my place he broke up with me, he said he was worried about incompatibility causing issues for us in the future, I was devastated I love him and I blame myself for him leaving me. He said he wanted to be friends but hasn‚Äôt reached out since the breakup and I‚Äôve just continued to spiral since, I miss him and I feel alone all the time going to school feels I‚Äôm not even there just flying on autopilot and every moment hurts. I don‚Äôt think he knows how much it‚Äôs effected me though I heard through a mutual friend that he was feeling guilty that he‚Äôd upset me. Which makes me feel even worse, I despise myself and everything about me. If I‚Äôd been prettier would he have left me? If I was less awkward? More affectionate? Funnier? Less of a loner? I just want him back but it‚Äôll never happen and I don‚Äôt know what I did. He was my reason to get up, my reason to live I felt so safe in his arms and now I‚Äôll never feel that way again and I‚Äôll never speak to him again, he said he wanted to be friends but he has so many why would he want a freak like me. It‚Äôs pushed me to the edge, every day that he doesn‚Äôt message and want to get together again just pushes me farther. I don‚Äôt look after myself, I go days without eating or sleeping I don‚Äôt take my meds or do my makeup cuz I don‚Äôt want to be alive on my days off I just sleep I‚Äôm not even tired it‚Äôs just preferable to consciousness. I‚Äôve become more suicidal the past week, I step out into traffic, and last Thursday on the walk to my bus stop I stepped over the railing of a bridge and came close to just letting go it would‚Äôve been so easy, and to finally have peace. The only thing that stops me doing it is the hope that he‚Äôd take me back, but each day that doesn‚Äôt happen the closer I come. Do I need help? probably, do I care no. And no one else does, my mom certainly doesn‚Äôt. Thank you for giving me space to talk.

I try to challenge myself in life but by trying new things I actually just end up giving up on it beause it puts a terrible strain on me. For example wanting to do volontary work abroad, university studies, trying a new workplace or I tried to own a pet twice now but due to terrible anxious reactions I had to give them back after a few days. My anxiety manifests by having terrible stomach pain that makes me vomit and prevents me from sleeping days on end, it continues with panic attacks, diarrhea, weight loss and so on.

I was severely bullied in high school. It wasn‚Äôt just the typical school drama‚Äîit was relentless, humiliating, and left scars that ran deep. As a trauma response, I completely isolated myself right after graduating. I cut off everyone, not just my bullies but also those who stayed friends with them. I wanted nothing to do with anyone associated with that chapter of my life.

Fast forward to today. I hit a breaking point and needed immense help, so I begged my parents to take me to a psychiatric hospital. It was a hard decision, but I knew I had to do it for myself. But life? Life has a twisted sense of humor.

To my bad luck, my high school bully was there. At first, I thought she was admitting herself, but no‚Äîshe was just there with her grandmother. Still, the moment she saw me, she greeted me, and I responded coldly. And then? She had this look. This smug, satisfied look. She immediately pulled out her phone, typed something in her group chat, and kept glancing at me. I couldn‚Äôt see what she was saying, but I felt it. Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking, but given our history, I don‚Äôt think so.

This is the same girl who went around spreading lies about me, claiming I was ‚Äúcompeting‚Äù with her when I had long stopped paying attention.

I regularly suffer from debilitating panic attacks that leave me emotionally raw, and physically ill and in pain.  I have yet to figure out how to socialize normally, and even when someone understands that my social blunders are mistaken and is willing to forgive those, I am prone to seizures that functionally reset whatever thought I was trying to convey.

I am being treated for my depression and anxiety, and I'm being referred to a neurologist for my seizures.  But even if the anxiety and seizures can somehow be curbed, I am still pretty much incompetent when it comes to socializing, and my Therapist reminds me every appointment about a heirarchy of needs, and how I can't build a proper life without fulfilling the human interaction need.

I don't do much else. and due to all of these things showering has become incredibly difficult, not only the effort and the fact that I have to leave my room, but I hate being naked, I hate being wet, I hate being wet and cold and putting on clothes when I'm wet. I let my hair get so bad I had to shave my head. Well, today I was in the bathroom doing what you do in the bathroom and I thought, I'm gonna take a shower. I had my husband bring me towels and razors and everything and I just got in the shower, There was no trying to talk myself in or out of it. I just did it. And then I went on to clean a whole lotta shit that I have been neglecting.

12tupz1,Yeah my wife wants to leave me,mentalhealth,1682064717.0,91,97,"I found a letter she wrote that she intended to give to me tomorrow. I was by myself, alone and my house. My wife had left for something I wasn‚Äôt invited to and I happened across the letter. 

Basically the whole thing boils down to she thinks I‚Äôm unhappy in our marriage, she says she‚Äôs unhappy with our marriage and wants to begin the process for divorce.

This shattered me to a million pieces.lately I‚Äôve been dealing with more stress and anxiety than I ever have and finding that letter broke me.

I told her I found the letter and I had left one of my own explaining the mental health issues I‚Äôve been dealing with, apologizing for her being drawn into it and for all the times I tried to cope in an unhealthy way.

my wife is going to tell me she wants a divorce. I do not want a divorce.

Tomorrow is going to be an extremely difficult day for me  (or today at this point by now)

I‚Äôve seen the writing on the wall, I haven‚Äôt been the husband she deserves for a multitude of reasons but, she‚Äôs been the wife I‚Äôve needed to keep me under control.

I don‚Äôt want to lose my wife. I wrote a letter for her explaining in excruciating detail that I‚Äôve been dealing with mental health issues that have otherwise left me failing as a proper husband and consistently letting her down and breaking promises (not in spite of her) 

I know what‚Äôs coming and I dread it more than anything I ever have before. Tomorrow is judgement day it would seem and I‚Äôm worried about how I‚Äôm going to manage without her should she ultimately decide to leave.

I have no intention of forcing her to stay in a marriage she is unhappy in, I just feel like we‚Äôve never really tried to make things work and I want to at the very least try.

We‚Äôre going to talk tomorrow about how we are going to proceed and I really just need some support.

I don‚Äôt know what her absolute decision will be but based on what I read, she has been done with this marriage for long time

I still love her, she is the only reason I have a degree and a job related to the degree I obtained.

This past March was our 5th year wedding anniversary, I did not anticipate that it could be our last. 

I‚Äôve been stuck in a dark place for the past few weeks and I don‚Äôt want to lose my wife.

She seems to think we‚Äôve been living a loveless marriage, which I will accept blame for not fulfilling my end of the intimacy aspect of the relationship. I don‚Äôt meant to imply this is entirely my fault however I do accept that in my imperfect actions as a husband also contributed to this situation.

My wife seems to think I don‚Äôt love her. I do, more than I could ever explain.

I travel frequently for work and I feel like this has not only contributed to the strife in my marriage but also driven me to the brink of insanity.

I took the job because it was the best offer after I a graduated and I thought it would be in both of our interests for me to take it as it was a significant pay increase compared to what I was making. (I did not make this decision without her)

I think this job has contributed to the downfall of the relationship between my wife and myself.

These next few days are going to be very hard for me, I feel like I‚Äôve matured 10 years over the span of a week, the stress and anxiety have been unbearable. 

I don‚Äôt want to lose my wife, she is the light in my life but, I‚Äôm not going to try to force her to stay in a marriage that she does not think she can be happy in.

It‚Äôs rough, guys and I am not looking forward to our conversation but, I need to find closure one way or the other or I‚Äôm going to lose my mind.



***********************UPDATE************************

I have just reopened Reddit since posting this. There are a lot of comments and I will get around to answering those of you I am able to as I am able to.

Just as a little general answer as to how things are at the moment: 

I‚Äôve found peace in this situation and have been preparing myself for whatever the final outcome of my marriage is.

I‚Äôve been staying with my parents for a week, I‚Äôve been getting counseling, I was started in an antidepressant and right now I‚Äôm going through the wonderful effects that starting an antidepressant brings.

My wife and I are separating for a year, she is taking our dog and will be living in Iowa with her grandmother for the next year until she has to return for school.

I feel like I‚Äôm starting to come out of a lifetime of being on autopilot and feel hope for my future for the first time in years.

That‚Äôs all I can think of for now, heads a little fuzzy because of antidepressant but overall mental health is looking up at the moment.

I am on sick leave because I drive trucks and not sleeping is a no go for that kind of work. I have a normal 8-10h job, come home at the end of the day. I have always had depression, got bullied in school by my incompetent teachers who did not know what dyslexia was. I go to the gym atleast once every 2 days.

I could sleep before without much problems, I was feeling tired no matter how long I slept. Now my wife is pregnant at 5th month. We have no family close by, so we are on our own. Because of my depression I have a hard time to make friends. My one and only friend is a 10h drive away, but he is suffering much worse than me, he have talked many times about taking his life. I did go to him and helped him, but now I dont have the energy anymore. The roof leaked in December, this made my anxiety explode. After that I wake up at even the slightest dripping sound


 I try to forget how horrible I feel, at best I can distract myself with games or reading. 


It feels like hundred of thousands of thing are piling up in my mind and when I lie down to sleep I stare at the ceiling for 2 hours before giving up. I am even taking tablets with Melatonin, they just makes me sleepier but does not put me to sleep, so not really helpful. Last night after taking the pills and finally managed to fall asleep, my wife slapped me in my chest, waking me up at 2am... I got so pissed.

My wife has been so annoying, she can't stand being alone, while I ""need"" alone time. I am bearly functioning and she is getting pissed at me for being ""lazy"", while I am dysfunctional. She makes me feel like I am suffering the moment I am forced to be around her. Every time she opens her mouth it is complains. Every time I try to build up motivation she crushes it.

1jj0eqs,"psychiatrist prescribed Vortioxetine after 5 mins‚Äî (21M, engineering student)",mentalhealth,1742846729.0,7,0,"Hey everyone,  
I‚Äôve been struggling for¬†*years*¬†with what I thought could be ADHD (or something similar), but after finally working up the courage to see a psychiatrist , I left feeling more confused than helped. I‚Äôd really appreciate some advice or shared experiences.

**My symptoms:**

* **Focus/Attention:**¬†My brain feels like a browser with 100 tabs open. I‚Äôll sit down to study, blink, and suddenly 3 hours are gone‚Äîwith nothing done. Time just‚Ä¶ evaporates.
* **Motivation:**¬†Even tiny tasks (like watching a 10-minute lecture or writing a few lines of code) feel like climbing a mountain. I procrastinate until the guilt is unbearable.
* **Mental State:**¬†Constantly exhausted, stuck in my own head (hours of self-talk), and frustrated at how hard ""normal"" things feel.
* **Social Anxiety:**¬†Sweating buckets around people, zero social life, and paralyzing indecision (even picking what to eat is stressful).
* **The hospital experience:** I prepared a¬†*whole list*¬†of these symptoms to discuss, but the doctor skimmed it, asked maybe 2 questions, and prescribed¬†**Vortioxetine** ¬†in under 5 minutes. When I looked it up later, I saw it‚Äôs an antidepressant‚Äînot what I expected, since I was wondering about ADHD
* No discussion about side effects, no explanation of why an antidepressant . Just:
* **""Take 5mg for a week, then 10mg for a month, come back later.""**
* **No warning about potential side effects**¬†(I looked it up later and saw stuff about¬†**sexual dysfunction, nausea, etc.**‚Äîkinda frightened me ).

**My doubts:**

1. Has anyone taken Vortioxetine for similar issues? Did it help with focus/motivation,  mood?
2. ¬†Did you initially get misdiagnosed with depression? How did you get reevaluated?
3. **Meds combo:**¬†I‚Äôm already on Azathioprine (for Crohn‚Äôs)‚Äîanyone on both?
4. I‚Äôm torn between giving this med a fair shot (maybe depression¬†*is*¬†causing my symptoms?) and feeling dismissed. Traveling to a different was a huge effort , and I can‚Äôt afford wasted trips.",life is unbearable
1joyo4b,SSRI Alternative for Anxiety/Panic Disorder,mentalhealth,1743521937.0,4,1,"Hi everyone, 

  
I'm looking for some advice/experiences with SSRI's/other forms of anti-depressants for Anxiety/panic disorder. To summarise my experiences so far:

  
\- I tried taking Citalopram but had extreme side effects including nausea, loss of apetite and worst of all extreme anxiety to the point I couldn't sit still and would pace around the house

\- I tried taking amitriptyline however again I had unbearable anxiety 

\- I have recent tried Sertraline however the same thing again, agitation, extreme anxiety where I could hardly sit still

  
I take Proponolol without any negative affects at all but this just isn't enough for me, it only blunts physical symptoms. 

  
I have also undergone a lot of CBT over the last 10 years with mixed results. 

  
My life in general is up and down and for the most part I get by, but sometimes I want more than that.

  
The most recent attempt at Sertraline included taking half a pill initially but this ended up the same way as the others in the end with anxiety through the roof and losing a lot of weight. It's all a bit disheartening! 



Has anyone got any suggestions for alternative medicines to give a go? It would be helpful to know i'm not now at a dead end as i'm really looking to improve my life.

1jo8p7n,Why Does Happiness Feel So Short?,mentalhealth,1743441853.0,1,1,"Hi. Lately, I've been feeling so depressed and unmotivated. I thought writing it down might help.I don‚Äôt understand why happiness is so fleeting. It comes and goes like a brief spark, while hard times feel endless. It makes me wonder, why does happiness last so short? And if happiness is the reason we live, doesn‚Äôt that make sadness unbearable? It feels dangerous to rely on happiness as motivation because the moment it fades, everything crumbles.

So what should be the reason we keep going? What should be our strength when happiness isn‚Äôt enough?

Also, I fear people more and more over time. People let me down over and over again. Trust feels so light now, like it means nothing anymore in 2025. I‚Äôve had good friends, I‚Äôve had good relationships, and every time, I thought I found something real only to end up devastatingly disappointed. But for some reason, I never stop trying. Deep down, I believe that someday, there will be something more. I believe in soulmates and destiny which I think it is as rare as lottery.

I don‚Äôt even know why I overthink all of this. Some people seem to move through life without these struggles. Am I just mentally weak? But sometimes I can endure any emotional hazard and come out standing. I don‚Äôt know. I feel like I‚Äôm constantly at war with myself.

Does anyone else feel this way? If you‚Äôve been through this, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts. I feel so lost. l'm sighing like +60 times a day lol.",life is unbearable

Basically I'm stuck forever being terminally online with no method of meeting anyone or making friends or going anywhere, etc.

I cannot for the life of me get along with anyone online so online friendships are out of the question, all I can do is browse Twitter all day and end up getting into arguments and it really messes me up, I just get filled with uncontrollable sadness and anger from online arguing all the time and it leaves me with 3 options; Smash posessions, hurt myself, try to hold it in and just make it worse and not get over it for the rest of the day

I'm poor and i keep making myself even more poor by breaking things so I'd like to stop doing that, so my only options for dealing with my life are cutting myself to relieve tension and take my mind off things (since the pain is a good distraction) or just sit with those feelings and let them snowball into a full-on meltdown

So, what's the healthier option here? I feel like giving myself physical pain is far better than having multiple breakdowns every day, right? It's easier to live with, at least.

1cwl2na,My high school counselor let me keep cutting myself and I ended up in a mental hospital.,mentalhealth,1716225880.0,1,1,"This is my first and possibly only post, but I wanted to share my story. I have a handful of mental health issues that in high school I didn‚Äôt know how to cope with. One day, my friends caught me with a binder spine that I had ripped out and bent to the point it snapped in half. I used the sharp edges to cut myself. It wasn‚Äôt very deep given the tool I was using, but it was self harm nonetheless. I had a history of self harm since middle school so this wasn‚Äôt new for me.

When my friends saw what I was doing, they all but dragged me to the school counselor. I didn‚Äôt want to, but I told the woman, let‚Äôs call her Ms. Smith, that I was cutting myself and pulled the broken binder spine from my purse to show her what I was using. I didn‚Äôt want her to take it away since it was my (very unhealthy) comfort. Deep down though I wanted help. I knew what I was doing was bad and I needed to stop. To my shock and horror, she didn‚Äôt care. She just talked to me and asked why I did it. I gave a basic answer: I wanted to.

The reality I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing with this stranger was that I needed the release. Seeing the blood coming out of me when I cut myself with anything felt like all the emotions I couldn‚Äôt get out was released. I didn‚Äôt think it would make sense to anyone so I never told them. Thinking back on it, I‚Äôm glad I never told Ms. Smith.

After talking for a few minutes, in which I also told her I was having a lot of suicidal thoughts, she asked me if I was ready to go back to class. It felt like a punch to the gut. She didn‚Äôt care that I was hurting myself. She didn‚Äôt try to take away the tool I was using. She just wanted me to focus on school and leave her alone. This made me loose so much faith in people who were supposed to be there to help. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt trust anyone to help me. I didn‚Äôt want to stop, but I also really did if that makes sense.

I told Ms. Smith that no, I wasn‚Äôt ready. I wanted to kill myself. I wanted to die. Why didn‚Äôt she care? Did no one care about me? But all I told her was no. She called my parents, but only my dad was available to pick me up. She gave dad the run down of what we talked about before we went home. Dad wanted to stay there and talk to me about it all, but I was hurting too much from how Ms. Smith handled it all to really open up to dad. Instead, I just got angry with him and my mom and at the world. I was angry with my friends for making me go there.

Eventually dad took me home. He told mom about it all and she practically shut down. I later learned she had called her therapist and asked what the heck she should do. Her therapist told her to keep an eye on me and if I brought up suicide again to take me to the hospital. Instead of comforting me and trying to help, my parents made me do manual labor. They said if I was going to skip school I was going to work instead. At the time, they were hurting so much that their daughter was in such a dark place that they handled it all in a way they shouldn‚Äôt have and I know now how much they regret that.

I was forced to dig a fire pit in the back yard and I hated every second of that. We were already going to have one there and it became my job to dig it when I was feeling suicidal. After school got out, my then boyfriend called to ask where I had gone. He was a crap boyfriend. While I was on the phone with him, I had also moved on to helping mom sort out the costumes in the basement. I was ignoring mom but talking loudly enough for her to hear. I told my then boyfriend all about how my parents didn‚Äôt care and that they just wanted me to do work when I was feeling suicidal. That almost broke mom. She and dad were doing the best they knew how and lo and behold I mentioned suicide again. Mom told dad to get ready, they were taking me to the hospital. My then boyfriend told me to lock myself in the bathroom so they couldn‚Äôt take me. I did for a bit but eventually came out. I had given up. We all got in the car and dad told mom to sit in the back seat with me so I couldn‚Äôt try to hurt him. It‚Äôs been years since then and that memory still breaks my heart. I was angry with them but I would never hurt my parents.

That day was the first time I had ever seen my dad cry. He isn‚Äôt a very emotional person, so seeing that hurt worse than everything else I was feeling.

We drove to the ER and they checked me in. Eventually I was taken back to a room where a nurse asked me all sorts of questions about what was going on. I wish I had lied. I wish I had told the nurse I was fine. But no, I made the stupid mistake of being honest. He told my parents I needed to go to a ‚Äúbehavioral institution‚Äù which let‚Äôs be real, is a mental hospital. The only one with available beds was three hours away. Mom looked the place up to see what it was like and voiced her concerns on how terrible the reviews were. Years later when we talked about it she told me she wished she had put her foot down and told them no. Their daughter wasn‚Äôt going to go there.

The hospital staff brought me paper scrubs to change into. Paper. Freaking. Scrubs. All I could keep on was my underwear. No bra, just underwear and paper scrubs. It was humiliating on top of everything else. I had to be driven to the mental hospital in the back of a police car with my parents following behind.

The officer was as nice as can be, asking what I wanted to listen to on the radio and if the temperature was okay. I told him all of it was fine and spent the whole three hours silently sobbing. When we finally arrived at the nut house it was late at night. All the other crazy people were asleep. A nurse offered me a sad ham sandwich and a diet ginger ale for dinner. To this day I cannot drink that because of the association with that place.

My parents gave me a tearful goodbye and told me they love me. I couldn‚Äôt say it back. I couldn‚Äôt speak at all. I was taken to a room with another girl already asleep, and told we would all be woken up at 6am to have our vitals checked. I‚Äôm not a morning person at all. More like a perpetually exhausted chicken. That news was just another thing on top of everything else that made the day the worst of my life.

I could barely sleep that night. There was a security camera in the room watching me and my roommate. I still have a fear of security cameras due to that red cyclops eye always monitoring me. There was a small bathroom in the room with a thin sheet for ‚Äúprivacy.‚Äù The camera was aimed in a way they could see our silhouette as we showered and used the toilet. I understand the need for keeping an eye on all of us since we were all there for mental issues, but it was still awful to suffer through.

This mental hospital had a thing called ‚Äúdrop anchor.‚Äù That meant the residents did something to get in trouble, and the punishment was everyone had to stay in their rooms unless it was time to eat or have group therapy. It was both torture and a blessing. When I arrived, they were a few days into drop anchor, so I stayed in my room like the rest. A nurse told me since I wasn‚Äôt in trouble I didn‚Äôt have to do that, but it was better than being alone in the mentally messed up adolescence wing lobby.

I made it a few days without having to interact with more than my roommate before drop anchor was lifted. We were forced to go to the gym and participate in sports and meditation, group therapy, and meeting with a doctor. None of us were allowed to sit too close to each other or, Heaven forbid, touch. No hugs or even a pat on the shoulder. We couldn‚Äôt even have our legs up while sitting in a chair. There were so many rules that it was a prison more than a place to help people who were in such a dark place we needed to escape from the world to get help.

We even had scheduled bathroom breaks there. I couldn‚Äôt make it to the bathroom break one day and begged the nurse to unlock my door so I could go but was told to wait. It got to the point where it was painful to hold it in. I was sweating and almost in tears trying to hold it in. Finally, twenty minutes before the bathroom break, they gave up trying to keep me from peeing and let me go to my room. I didn‚Äôt make it and peed just a foot away from the bathroom. The security camera saw it all and whoever was monitoring the footage did too. Humiliation stacked on to misery. I had to change and clean myself off as best I could with toilet paper since our shower supplies was locked away. When I came out, the nurses acted like I should be beyond thankful they let me go early. I could have strangled them.

We were given visitors day and my parents came to see me. I was still angry with them for sending me there. They both looked so relieved to see me and heartbroken that I was at a mental hospital. I remember shouting at them that they locked me in there and storming away. That‚Äôs a regret I still haven‚Äôt forgiven myself for, though I am trying.

I lied my way out. Each day we were told to fill out a sheet of how we were feeling mentally and if we had any thoughts of hurting ourselves or others. No, of course I don‚Äôt want to hurt myself. I‚Äôm perfectly fine. All cured. A week locked away made my mental issues so much better. If I had been honest I would have been kept there longer, so I lied my butt off to be free.

There was a very small library there. I borrowed a book about Hellen Keller that I remembered reading in middle school. That book kept me sane. I read it as often as I could, escaping into the story. One day, a nurse came to the lobby to tell us something or other, and told me to put my book away. I kept it open but set it down to keep my place. She yelled at me and told me they would take it away if I didn‚Äôt put it away fully. That book was my comfort, and this woman wanted to take it away from me. I saw red. I wanted to scream and shout and throw the book at her. But I knew I had to escape, so I did what she said.

It may sound dramatic, saying I wanted to escape. If you had been there you would understand. That place was terrible for everyone. It was a place to lock kids up instead of trying to help us heal. It was Hell.

Mom told the whole family that I was in there and the letters poured in. There was so much love and support that I was overwhelmed. I kept every single thing they wrote me. Even extended family that I wasn‚Äôt very close to wrote to me. When I‚Äôm in a dark place I go back and read those letters and it reminds me of the good in my life.

The whole experience, from the moment I was dragged to the guidance counselor to the moment I was checked out of the nut house, was awful. For years I couldn‚Äôt even talk about it. I couldn‚Äôt say the name of the place without having a severe anxiety attack. It took a lot of therapy to finally talk about it. When I passed police officers on the road anxiety set in, even though the officer who drove me there was kind. Security cameras still freak me out. So much of my life was affected because of that week.

When I finally came home I felt like a stranger. One week away in a mental hospital and I was the family outcast. Everything was different and so hard. I should have been thrilled to be home, but it was almost as bad as the nut house.

I‚Äôve forgiven my parents for taking me there, though. I know they were doing the best they knew how to do, and they‚Äôve sincerely apologized for it all. They felt awful for it too. It took a while for all of us to heal, but we eventually did. At least I can look back on that time when I‚Äôm in a dark place and remember that if I could survive that I can survive anything.",cutting myself

- always thinking 10 steps ahead and living in the future instead of looking at what‚Äôs right infront of them and being present in the moment.

i hate myself when i see my parents with that disappointed look on their faces while talking to me, it's like i feel bad for myself thru them lol but then i remember that i basically have no more friends left, idk if having a childhood friend that is also a junkie who i smoke weed with twice a month when he has no one else to call counts as friend, no job except working a part time job once a year, i worked a 2nd one in construction until just recently, but was fired after 10 days because i was ""not needed anymore"", no girlfriend, that makes my mom so sad sometimes because she wants grandchildren so badly

where i'm from if you're in your 20s and still living with your parents and you're not having a decent explanation for it you are instantly a failure and ppl look at you weird because roughly 90% of ppl i know are either in college, or having a job and a decent social life or all 3 at once, i have NONE

for the last 3 years of being a depressed shut-in i didn't grow as a person at all i still have the same ambitions, when i ran into an old friend couple weeks ago he told me how the fuck am i still stuck in being a teenager, because i always tell the same jokes, do the same inappropriate things, talk the same...

my god it absolutely fucking hurts seeing my old friends being so normal, so happy, taking pic after pic from vacation, having beautiful girls, some getting married even, having decent jobs, a place of their own while i spend 80% of my time on reddit, youtube, facebook, watch tv shows, listen to music and play games sometimes

i can't see my life getting better because i've already tried some things and it didn't help, and good luck for me having a girlfriend because who the fuck wants a guy who is 22 and still living with his parents and basically never goes out, plus i gained like 20 pounds in the last 2 months, so not only i'm socially anxious and depressed as hell now i'm also chubby on top of all that, the only thing i do outside of the house is drive around with my bike every other day, visiting places i spent happiest and the most careless days of my life with my friends, i visit places where we'd get drunk and go to night clubs during 2011- 2013, then go out of town to see the beautiful landscape that makes me feel alive and then back to home

lbpsfo,my pain (25F) is overwhelming: i've been quarantining in an abusive household for the last year and am in need of some kind words,depression,1612365528.0,91,1137,"i've been struggling a lot this week. my mental health has always been shit but lately, it's just gotten worse. i recently fired my therapist because my insurance changed and she wasn't accepting the new provider (she wasn't a good fit for me either, but something is better than nothing). so aside from my boyfriend and a few friends, i don't have anyone i can rely on. i feel bad venting to the people around me because they're all going through tough times too and it just doesn't feel fair for me to unload on them. so i hope that opening up to this sub is the right idea, even though i still feel guilty expressing my pain.

the heart of it all is that i have C-PTSD (along with other psych disorders) and these past few weeks I've been drifting in and out of disassociation, flashbacks, and episodes of crying fits. i can't stop reliving my trauma and am having a tough time with positive self-talk. right now i'd say my self-worth and self-esteem are at a 0. it doesn't help that i live in an abusive household but unfortunately i don't have anywhere else to go, and this is something I've dealt with my whole life. my mother is neglectful and my father is emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abusive. he picked a fight with me this morning for no reason and it set me over the edge. so between the flashbacks, disassociation, and deeply painful depression, i just feel so unsafe in my house. if my parents see me crying, they'll either gaslight or bully me. i just wish things were different. i don't really know where i'm going with this post other than it would be nice to be reminded that not everyone is mean and nasty. that i am a good person and i deserve a good life. i just want to stop crying.

It's something that's been happening to me since I was little. I remember wanting to kill myself and even preparing to do it when I was caught skipping school when I was 13. I was ready to do it. Only reason I didn't get to go ahead with it was because I was seen walking on the streets by someone I knew and they took me home. 

Fast forward to today. My mental state was quite stable and i was okay until I had a triggering conversation with my dad where he called me stupid and that set me off.

This exam will determine my specialty. I couldnt study as i wanted but i can take this exam in august too. I mean there is compansation. In my mind i know this is not that important there is nothing to make me this miserable. But i cant help it. I feel like everyone expects from a lot from me and they will be so dissapointed and think that i am stupid. I cant cope with failing. I would rather die than failed. I cant get out from my bed. I am sleeping all day. This morning i wrote suicide letters for my family in my mind. I know maybe ypu think i am just spoiled. But i really want to get better. I spoke with my parent i told them i want to restart to therapy. But therapy let me down so many times. I just want to ask is there anyone that felt like me and now feels better? Or any advice? There is no one with mental illness in my family or my circle of friends. So they dont understand me. I want to ask you guys. Maybe someone in here knows what i am feeling now... ",i cant cope

I was going to take a week off to manage my burnout and for my birthday. Instead I got seriously injured and had to use my time on various medical appointments. Instead I had one day off that got interrupted with a work emergency. On my birthday. Now more fires need to be put out in the next two weeks. My dog just had tk have surgery and that cost $800. One of my cats just had a medical issue for another $200. My medical costs are adding up.

I'm tired. Everything is hitting at once and I am do tired. I finally almost paid off my debt and now this happened. My partner is loving and supportive but I don't like having to dump everything on them. They did almost everything while I was at the worst part of my injury and they're still helping out. 

I feel so useless. I feel so overwhelmed and tired and stressed and I just want to disappear. I just want to go to bed and stay there and not have to get out. But I can't because I have a job and I need the job to pay all the medical bills and I need to take care of the pets. But Im so so tired. I just want a break from life",i cant cope

I just couldn't do it mentally and it makes me feel worthless knowing that the reason why people are mad at me is my fault. And I submitted my work in late again, and now my dad's mad at me. He doesn't really care for excuses so when I tried to tell him that I'm struggling his response is that if I'm given a deadline I have to meet it. He's right.

1ibe202,2 years ago from today i had my biggest downfall of my life and i still cant cope with it  (THIS IS A LONG PARAGRAPH YOU WILL ONLY UNDERSTAND IF YOU READ EVERYTHING),depression,1737997443.0,0,1,"This started in 2023 when i just turned 14,little backstory,i always liked video games like a lot and i never had a pc and i always wished for one but having 3 other brothers money was not on my side.I always used to watch my big brother play on his pc,he always gave me permission to play on it too but it wasnt the best experience,the pc was very old like from 2015 and i could only play for 1 hour a day,it was good but i was never satisfied i wanted my own pc who had decent specs.
Fast forward in april 2023 i sold my phone and a unused bed my parents had and i got about 1200$ which i used to buy my own specs for a pc.
Took 2 months to get everything and my dad happily helped me build it,i finally had a good pc for my own use and i was very happy after alot of years playing mobile games.
I played very much on it about 8-10 hours a day,i noticed i didnt go outside as much as usual and i started feeling angry at games every time i gamed,but i was still healthy physically and i didnt mind it.Untill i started to not care about my pc after getting into competitive games like valorant and csgo,i started punching my unity and my monitor alot,my parents noticed it and talked with me telling me ""dont forget you are hitting the things that you always wished for"",those talks workek only for some days untill i started raging again,the day finally came and i broke my first monitor,i was very sad but mom bought me a new one 1 week later,same thing again it only took less than 2 months to break my second monitor,and that process repeated untill i broke my 3rd and last monitor,i noticed a decline in my menthal health and i decided to sell my pc and buy a good phone so i can quit games,and so i did.
First 2 months were good untill i started missing the games and my pc,i was not as happy as before but i was sure more healthy.
Sadly my brain wouldnt understand that and i was slowly going into depression,i started to buy cigarettes to stop stressing about little things but it didnt work. I used my highschool friends as an escape from those addictions and it worked very good i was playing football with them being happy,thats untill the beggining of 2024 came.
Just got back from school on a friday,weekend was about to come,and i felt the urge smoke,and i thought i could steal without getting caught,i left the house without anybody knowing making my way to the store,i entered and stole 5 packs and left running,store owner cahsed me and this situation ended in a brawl which almost got him killed,after some punches between me and him he fell to the ground head first getting a concussion,i was arrested and charged with robbery and attempted m!rder,spent 7 months in detention center and got out on house arrest  (mind you im waiting on conviction)  when i got home i was very happy to see my family again,i talked alot with them and always stood togheter more than ever,but the video games started to make their way into my brain again,and the urge to get a pc asap came back.
That was the last thing that happened,i wrote this to hope some people who read all of this(very rare) will help me guide my path into what should my interests should be so i can live happy,should i try to get a pc again or get rid off video games?",i cant cope
1gxk7nm,I might have depression. It came as a complete surprise and I hate the thought of it. I can't cope.,depression,1732314499.0,1,1,"I recently started seeing a psychiatrist, suspecting ADHD and an anxiety disorder. So far, she tells me the signs are pointing to depression. There is no verdict yet, but the possibility really, really scares me. I would have been fine if it really was just ADHD and anxiety. I expected those to show up, and already came up with solutions. ADHD is just my brain working differently, and it's very treatable, I've done a lot of research on it and found a lot of helpful things that worked for me. 

But when she talked about depression at first, I wrote it off. My bad days were really bad, and I have been under suicidal ideation for 2 years, but I also have a lot of energy. I feel joy very intensely when I do feel it, and I can light up a room I'm in on my good days. Depression just... doesn't make sense to me. I mean absolutely no offense to anyone struggling with this, I know how hard it can be, especially if I do, in fact, have it, but I don't see this sub helping.

Every OP in here is struggling with hopelessness, self loathing, suicidal thoughts, and there is nothing to change things. There is no comfort, no solutions, no one actually being helped by the rate I see posts like this. Scrolling for one minute is enough to destroy my mood. I don't want to be like that. I don't want to constantly spiral down into hopelessness, push people away, hurt my loved ones because they're being burnt out trying to comfort me every time I get low.

I went in expecting to find out how my brain works so I can make things better. But I'm so scared now. I really hope it's not actually depression, because the mere thought of having it depresses me even more. I don't see hope in this, which is what depression is in the first place, but in a sub where everyone struggles with this, there is no one to comfort anyone else.",i cant cope

1e1wldd,My entire life is about to change and I can't cope. Depressed for the first time in my life,depression,1720828972.0,2,2,"I've been living with my ex gf for 5 years. It's been a really long time and she was my first ever gf. We broke up roughly a year and a half ago but we have still been living together with her two cats (who we got as kittens 5 years ago). We've had our ups and downs and argue sometimes, but we also laugh together and I do enjoy talking to her.

A few weeks ago, she suddenly told me that she will be moving to her own place. I understand why she wants to, but it just came as a shock to me. My little brother is in a bad situation at the moment, and he comes here every week to stay with us. He looked extremely sad and worried when I told him that I'll have to leave, and this made me more upset.

To make matters worse, she's taking the cats (who I have bonded with and lived with since they were kittens). She's leaving today and I'm really dreading it and feel extremely upset about it. I'll move to my grandmother's house in a few weeks, and I'm REALLY not looking forward to that but I have no other option.

Another thing is that I have had a new serious relationship for roughly a year, but she also hasn't been able to live with me. And to make things even worse....it seems like she will break up with me soon. It kind of feels like I'm losing two people at once (along with my cats) and also won't be able to hang out with my little brother regularly anymore.

The only light at the end of the tunnel is that I might finally be able to realize my dream and live overseas in 6 months. Not having to pay rent anymore by living at my grandmother's house will enable me to save up and finally go. That makes me really nervous but I'm also excited as it is my dream.

I'm usually a happy-go-lucky person and rarely get sad, but this is the first time in my life that I feel genuinely depressed and really upset. Not sure how to handle it and would really appreciate some advice.

I have severe anxiety and depression. I've been struggling for years now and it only ever gets worse, I keep thinking it surly can't get worse but soon as I do it does. 

I have no chance at ever having a normal life. I'm trans and I hate it. I'm autistic and I can't work because of it and I hate it. I have no family. I now have no friends either cuz of my depression. I can't do it anymore what's the point. No matter how much I tried to achieve anything it never worked out. Worked so hard on my dream kf being an indie game dev even released a game and it failed. Worked so hard in college I was able to skip straight into uni, where I was just met with disdain and disinterest from everyone else in my class as I was younger and not in there class the previous 2 years. 

I would be living alone in 2 months if I make it that far but what's the point. Due to autism and anxiety I can't work and I struggle to even leave the house. I can't make any progress on my transition either cuz I have no support from anyone, like u need 2 people to sign tk change your name for example, and my anxiety is so bad I can't go to a hair dressers alone or the doctors to try and get help with my depression, anxiety, autism etc. I can bearly even look after myself, if I have to leave the house for whatever reason I'm unable to even cook and eat, not even microwave anything. 

I've only ever had 1 friend. Only 1 person who has ever cared about me, well least she said she did. She decided that she can be bothered with me anymore as I'm too upsetting. Apparently cuz I'm struggling with depression it's too much for her and I'm dumping ""too much shit"" on her shoulders. I thought it was normal to talk to friends when your struggling and to ask them to spend time together and ask for help with things but apparently not. She said that I'm a burden and cruel for talking about it and that she'd be happier if we never met.

I have no point or reason to live at all. I'm completely alone. Soon to be living alone as well, my savings will run out soon enough too and as I have no support I can't get a garuntour for the second year, meaning I'll be homeless as of August at the very latest. The only reason I was still going was cuz I promised her I wouldn't kill myself cuz she said I couldn't leave her and that'd be cruel. But then she just goes and abandons me.

doqwow,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",depression,1572360722.0,177,2362,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",broken

1jj4bp3,From six-figure drug dealer to broken addict to finding life again‚Äîmy story,depression,1742856252.0,2,15,"I want to share this because someone here might be where I was, feeling stuck, hopeless, drowning in silence, and maybe too ashamed to ask for help. If that‚Äôs you, maybe this will help.

I didn‚Äôt grow up with much. By middle school, I was selling weed just to survive. My parents couldn‚Äôt afford much, and I hated asking them for things they didn‚Äôt have. By high school, I was making about $90 a day, and it felt like a fortune to a teenager. But it just kept growing.

When I got to college, things took off. I built a network across campuses and back home. By sophomore year, I was pulling in $400 net profit daily. I built up a solid operation over the years, growing my customer base through Snapchat, which became my full-time storefront. By what should‚Äôve been my senior year, I was making around $200,000 profit annually, not in sales, but pure profit.

I had workers, a lawyer on retainer, my own apartment, two cars, a Camry for blending in and a tuned Mercedes E53 AMG for speedy weekends. I even helped pay a chunk of my parents‚Äô mortgage. They thought I had a booming drop-shipping business. They were skeptical, but proud. On paper, I was winning. In reality, I knew I should stop this soon.

Then came the first big wake-up call.

One day, I was set to make $20,000 profit on a single delivery. My parents were visiting and accidentally blocked my Camry in, so I took the E53 AMG. Bad choice. I got pulled over for the exhaust because it was tuned. The cops saw part of a mushroom bag peeking from under the seat. I refused a search, but they brought in the dogs. They found half a pound of cocaine, multiple pounds of weed, Molly, LSD, and shrooms.

I was sure I was done. But my lawyer, one of the top guys for drug cases in my state, worked his magic. It cost me a lot, but the charges were dropped completely. I walked out of court free, but with a hole in my pocket. At that time, I was already using Percocets occasionally, just to take the edge off, but it wasn‚Äôt an everyday thing yet. Still, instead of seeing the arrest as a warning, I went right back to business.

Then the raid happened.

A few months later, my apartment door got kicked in by DEA agents and my local police department. They found my stash, scales, packaging, the whole setup. My lawyer came through again and got me probation, but this time it wasn‚Äôt just the legal system that shut me down.

The DEA and my town‚Äôs police department worked together to get my Snapchat account permanently banned and were strictly supervising my social media accounts. That was my entire pipeline. I had built that online business for 8 years, growing a customer base that reached far beyond my city. It was all gone overnight. No backup account, no reboots.

At that point, I took it as a sign from God to stop. I just gave up. I wasn‚Äôt even motivated to try rebuilding. That‚Äôs when the depression fully took over.

Suddenly, all the noise in my life, the deals, the adrenaline, the constant movement, it went silent. And when it got quiet, I was left alone with myself, and I hated what I saw. I felt like I was floating in this empty space, disconnected from everything. No purpose. No identity. Just a hollow version of the person I used to be. It‚Äôs like I was alive but invisible, nobody could really see how broken I was inside.

I‚Äôd lie in bed staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep, unable to move, just replaying all my failures over and over. The room would feel smaller every day, like the walls were closing in, suffocating me. I was surrounded by people who cared, but I felt more alone than I ever had. I didn‚Äôt want to be alone, but I also didn‚Äôt want anyone to see me like that. I isolated myself because I thought I deserved to suffer.

I‚Äôd have moments where I‚Äôd get up, thinking, ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll get it together today,‚Äù but within an hour, the weight of it all would slam me back down. I felt paralyzed, mentally and physically. The shame, the regret, the anger at myself, it sat on my chest like a truck. I couldn‚Äôt even look in a mirror without feeling disgust.

And that‚Äôs when the percocets started becoming a daily thing. What used to be occasional turned into dependence. Within a couple weeks, I was spending $250 to $500 every two days on pills. In less than a year, I threw away $80k just trying to numb my self

When pills got too expensive, I turned to heroin. I couldn‚Äôt believe I was snorting heroin, something I swore I‚Äôd never touch. But it was cheaper, and by that point, I didn‚Äôt care. I was desperate for numbness. I just needed relief, relief from the crushing guilt, the loss of control, the emptiness.

My parents watched me turn into a shell of who I once was. They didn‚Äôt understand how their son went from helping with their mortgage to locking himself in his childhood bedroom, barely eating, barely speaking, wasting away in front of them. They tried everything. Rehabs, tough love, soft love. Every time I relapsed, I could feel their hope slipping further away, and that only fed the darkness.

I hated myself. The self-loathing was unbearable. I felt like I had shattered my life beyond repair. I would scroll through old pictures of better times, and it felt like looking at a stranger. I didn‚Äôt recognize myself anymore. Every time I saw someone from my old life thriving, moving forward, I sank deeper. I felt stuck in quicksand, watching the world pass me by.

After years of this cycle and three stints in rehab, I was still an addict. The shame, the isolation, the self-doubt, it was like living inside a prison I built for myself. I didn‚Äôt want to die, but I didn‚Äôt really want to live either. I was just existing. Like a ghost haunting my own life.

Then my parents booked a trip overseas for the family. It was about six months away, and I told myself I‚Äôd somehow cut down so I wouldn‚Äôt go into full withdrawals on the trip. But I couldn‚Äôt taper fast enough. When we left, I was withdrawing hard, sweating, vomiting, trembling, trapped in my own skin. If you‚Äôve ever felt opioid withdrawals, you know, it feels like your body and soul are tearing apart. I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on my worst enemy. 

The first few weeks were pure agony. We tried to find help, but the medications I needed weren‚Äôt easily available in that country. By some miracle, in the third week, we found a doctor who got me something that eased the symptoms. It wasn‚Äôt Suboxone (the actual withdrawal medication) but it was enough to help me eat again and function. I was still weak, still broken, still crying silently at night, but somehow, I kept going.

When we came back home, I blocked my dealer‚Äôs number and flushed everything I had left. I‚Äôve been clean ever since, over a year now. 

Looking back, the raid might‚Äôve saved my life. Had I kept going, I probably would‚Äôve ended up in prison, shot in a deal gone bad, or overdosed alone in that apartment.

Six months into my sobriety, I started feeling that tiny spark again, the faint feeling that maybe, just maybe, there was still a future for me. I re-enrolled in college, and now I‚Äôm working toward my degree.

The hardest part wasn‚Äôt the arrests or the money lost, it was the quiet war with myself. The suffocating depression. The loneliness so heavy it made the air feel thick. The self-hate that made every day feel like a punishment. But I‚Äôm proof that even from that place, it can get better, little by little.

If you‚Äôre struggling right now, just know this, even if you feel like you‚Äôre at the bottom, even if you‚Äôre too ashamed to ask for help, even if it feels impossible, there‚Äôs still a way out.

He says he's broken and doesn't know what he feels about anything anymore. He is going to buy a house and says that if we try again later, we can rent that house and it'll be an investment.

As I write this I lay here in bed, end of summer at 2pm. I no longer see the reason in getting up, as at every single corner and every single thing I do or try ends in disappointment. I hope someone can relate, please. 

When I was in my pre/early teens i suffered from severe panic attacks, until I reached about 20 to which it turned into to full blown depersonalization disorder. I was so gone mentally and physically, totally agoraphobic. I was suicidal, not necessarily because of the depression but because I‚Äôd simply lost the person I once was.

I‚Äôm reaching 30 and I just so badly want to turn around and live that life. My inner demons have prevented me from all of that.

I feel as if my life lacks a substantial emotional fulfillment. I do not necessarily struggle financially due to the grace of my family. I have a robust social life. I do pretty good at school and I‚Äôm about to graduate. But I just don‚Äôt care about any of that anymore! I struggle to reconcile with the abuse I faced as a child. Both of my parents and even my abuser expect me to simply move on past it because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an adult now‚Äù in their words. But even though I have found it in my heart to forgive, that anger is still there, and I still feel hatred and sadness and resentment for the conditions for which I and my brother suffered under. I dread the feeling of waking up every day to another trudge through being alive in a world I want nothing to do with.

My mom said something to me today the likely never forget. She told me that she had already buried me in her mind, because after I had tried to kill myself one too many times in my youth, she had to focus more on my brother because at least he was probably going to live even if I didn‚Äôt.

She‚Äôs used that term so long to tug on my heart strings to keep me here, that it‚Äôs lost its magic on me. In my death I can afford be selfish because the dead don‚Äôt have the capacity to care.

I am a father to a newborn (NB)  and a stepfather to a teenage girl (SD)

The teenage girl is unfortunately out of control. She has cut herself on every part of her body, started huffing, among other things (vape smoking, possibly more) she os very challenged seeking older (30+) male attention, she is under 16 but being vague on age for obvious reasons. 

She has caused all of us to be pretty low, having to deal with the stresses and rows that follows each incident.  My partner is on anti depressants and I have found out today that she's stopped taking (not sure for how long, apparently none of my business). Due to her mood shes now ended it with me, claiming she's not fussed what happens to OP,NB,SD. As in she doesn't care if SD does something stupid (if you kmowmwhat I mean). I'm totally lost, Any thing I suggest I get shot down,  I have suggested being harsh on SD but get told that that isn't the right thing to.do, but letting SD do what she likes (going out with friends etc) is the right thing??? Now as far as I'm concerned if you do bad in life, at any age you should.be punished. Apparently I'm wrong for suggesting/ going on about ehat we should be doing. Am I right or wrong. 

I have tried to support my partner but apparently that's the wrong thing to do! What things should I do to adapt and support in different ways? I have tried being strong, listening, suggestion. Are there any other ways I can be supportive? 

What do I do with the relationship.  Do I continue to fight for this to work? Do I let the dust settle and see what she does when my partner calms down? Or do I walk away?

It doesn't help when I later have a panic attack and I can't figure out why I can't just adopt this mask and be normal. Why I can't just... Stop being sad. Stop being alone. Stop being desperate.

People who don‚Äôt have insomnia normally think the worst thing is that you don‚Äôt get a good nights sleep.
For me the worst thing is being alone with my thoughts. 
I‚Äôm scared of my thoughts. 
I have had insomnia ever since I was a kid I could never sleep my mom blamed it on tv. But the tv kept me sane. As I kid whenever the tv turned off I freaked out thinking about how someone could break in and kill us or I could get kidnapped. 
When I was little I was really scared of the zombie apocalypse. My dad would talk about it all the time and at some point I developed a fear. 
The voices of the tv helped me focus on something else it occupied my mind. Music made it worse I always found a way that I relate to something in the song and it was always bad. I shared a room with my mom I didn‚Äôt like it. So I always woke up and climbed into my aunts bed. My mom would get so mad at me. I never understood why.

I've been diagnosed with depression since I was like 14? 15? But I've never really had problems with it.
Well that has been until now, over the day nothings wrong I'm completely chill but when it's nighttime or just evening in general I get this disgusting overwhelming feeling of despair and sadness.
When this happens at night I can't really think clearly, my head feels cloudy, can't stop crying and both my heart and lungs just feel like they're getting crushed. I don't know why this is happening now I don't really have that much stress going on or anything that could be causing it I've been thinking about getting some sleeping pills to at least help me fall asleep because I can barely get more than 4 hours of sleep at night due to my symptoms.
I've already tried talking to my family about it and cutting off caffeine.

1gnrqna,"Insomnia, likely depressive personality disorder, anxiety and a lifetime of nothing.",depression,1731209980.0,0,1,"I'm 38 and I have had depression since I was a kid (Doctor said it was just a phase and nothing to worry about). Haven't been formally diagnosed with dpd/disthymia but when it lasts this long there's not much else it can be. Diagnosed with depression, not that it matters; didn't get any real support.

Sleep issues started around 11 or 12. Head would race every night. Took me hours to fall asleep so was always tired at school. Eventually started turning into insomnia around 18. 6 hours a night, eventually 3. 

Had a massive panic attack at work out of nowhere a few months before I turned 21. Haven't worked since. Became hypersomnic for a few years sleeping 12-18 hours a day, absolutely exhausted. That eventually settled back into insomnia and 3 hours a night or less and it's been like this ever since.

Anxiety isn't that bad these days. Barely ever leaving the house for 18 years helped with that. Glad the anxiety calmed down. Getting mini attacks whenever a phone would ring, or someone knocked at the door was tiresome. There were periods where I tried to go back out and be social but my depression always won in the end.

I'm so exhausted, physically and mentally all the time that I just can't do it. 

I was numb for so long so being alone didn't affect me as much. Eventually I stopped crying randomly. Unfortunately I became less numb over time as the body and mind can't deal with being like that constantly and it made everything worse because I'm so fed up of being alone, but there's nothing I can do about it. I do not have the energy or the will to make friends or have relationships. I don't deserve to have them. It's really hard to try and explain to someone that you're useless and they counter with, 'no you're not', like that somehow fixes it. I have wasted the best portion of my life, even if it wasn't through choice, and it's only downhill from here.

Drugs don't work for my depression or my insomnia. At least the ones I've tried (which is most types of anti-depressants. I haven't been on tranquilisers, but the newer insomnia medications, such as melatonin at the highest dose do nothing.

I hate the feeling that nothing is ever going to change, despite the fact that it is the way it is so there's no point complaining about it. 

I'm never going to be loved, or love; which is the only thing worth living for. Family are so apathetic. I got used to that many years ago. It hurts more because I feel I could be a decent partner for someone as long as they understood my shortcomings. I doubt I'd ever end up in a relationship anyway because I wouldn't let myself be in one. How could I? 

Aside from the few girlfriends I had back when I was 18/19 (although you could hardly call them relationships), I have never been hugged by anyone who meant it. This world is so incredibly empty and lonely and I am so tired.",insomnia

I spent years chasing a dream: excelling in school, pushing through a PhD, getting into R&D, and hoping it would all lead to purpose and impact. Instead, I found a system full of roadblocks, silence, and slow soul erosion. What happens when your love for problem-solving meets the machinery of indifference? When your passion is used, but never seen?

So I wrote it down. First as a form of therapy, and then as something bigger.

üìò¬†**Book 1:**¬†***Snowball of Garbage***  
This is where it all begins‚Äîan honest, raw dive into the early stages of disillusionment. The story isn't told like a typical memoir or novel; it jumps between perspectives, moments, and thoughts. Some chapters feel like you're in someone's mind, others feel like you're watching from the outside. It's about an engineer, but it's really about anyone who‚Äôs ever felt like the system is chewing them up while pretending to celebrate them.

The system won‚Äôt let go, and the world keeps applauding a version of him that no longer exists. It goes deeper into physiology, mental burnout, and the quiet desperation of wanting out but not knowing how.

Every morning I have to look in the mirror and see how much fatter I'm getting. I struggled with my weight my whole life and before the pandemic i got to a really good stature. Then I was in a car accident in '21 where the other driver didn't yield before turning and now I have 3 herniated discs in my back. Some days I wake up and just have to fight the pain. I got so depressed not being able to walk or sit normally for years that I couldn't stop eating. I would clear a bottle of 1800 tequila easy to help with the pain. It didn't help that my roommate at the time just sucked as a person and many times I had to pay more than my half of the rent because he just didn't work after losing his job or going to Oklahoma for 3 days and spent all his money on a dominatrix.

I never finished college because my alcoholic mom was AWOL during my junior year and I couldn't apply for student loans without her. I worked so many shitty jobs to survive. I was working 4 jobs at one point to keep my head above water. I finally had enough of mediocrity and tried banking. Finally got a chance to get licensed and work with investments but I always feel like because I have had such a shitty background, I'm always playing catch up with nepo babies who are successful without ever worrying. They don't worry about failing, they've rarely ever felt what true failure was. They've never had a job or partner reject them because of a stupid fucking piece of paper. Even now when my colleagues are telling me how well I'm doing at my job, I always have the voice in my mind telling me that I don't deserve it, I'm nothing and that all I'm doing is stalling until I just crash and burn. The newer people keep asking me for advice but they're better than me at this job. They have a safety net if they fail. They have people who care about them. They haven't had to buy new suits to compensate how fat they're getting.

I've had so many die in my life in the last few years. 2 of my friends committed suicide. Another died because of an asthma attack that he was too proud to ask for some money to refill his inhaler. My grandma died October last year from cancer. She was the only person in my family who would call and check in on me. She was always rooting for me. She always told me, ""–ò–¥–∏—Ç–µ –≤–ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥ (go forward.)"" She used to say when I was younger that I could be president.

After her death I tried to patch things up with my mom only to get arrested a few months later because of a lapsed registration ticket she never paid on a car in my name. I just stopped talking to my mom because I finally solidified that she's just not a good person. She always told me growing up how embarrassing it was to have a fat kid. When I was in school and had concerts or was given awards for how well I was doing, she'd not show up to date her loser boyfriends or make it seem like it was a an ordeal. I invited her to my student of the month breakfast I got my senior year of high school. My principle gave me student of year and cried during his speech about how much I've helped the school. She just complained how bad the food was and how much of a hassle it was to ask the court to leave house arrest for it. She blamed her 3 DUIs and her being laid off from her job on me and my sister. We ruined her life and she never had a problem to remind us. My sister stopped talking to her almost 15 years ago but I just kept hoping that one day she would be better. I kept thinking that even after she pushed me through a glass door over taking out the trash after I worked a double to afford school supplies at 17. She defrauded SSA living with my grandparents while she was between places and bring a ""caregiver"" to my grandpa, all while pressuring me to cosign a mortgage or use my address for mailing/residential purposes. 

Maybe she's right. Even senior advisors talk down to me because I couldn't finish college, surprised that such a worthless person was given the chance to be in this industry. It's so hard every day to go into work and try to do what seems like the impossible. I'm in pain from sitting or walking because I couldn't afford to take short term leave for proper physical therapy, only the bullshit kind from my PI lawsuit. My sister has a great life in another state and is happily married. She deserves it. I can't bring myself to be in a relationship anymore because there are days where I just hate myself and gaining so much weight makes me feel like I don't even deserve it to begin with. I don't tell her about anything in my life because I don't want to take away from her happiness. My grandpa has bad Alzheimers and it's so hard for me to speak with him because growing up he was the only male role model in my life and now he barely remembers who i am. Who am I? Honestly probably nothing. I asked my sister how I can help navigate the horrible feelings from speaking with him and her response was, I don't mean to sound like a bitch but just call him. Thanks.

My friends always see me as this happy go lucky guy who enjoys his drinks, but they never ask me how I'm holding up. When I'm bad mentally no one notices.

With literal snot dripping down my nose all day, I told a friend that I couldn't make her birthday plans tonight. Another person in the chat just said it was because of the malt liquor and everyone laughed. I'm glad that I'm not taken seriously.

So that's my rant. I'm here drinking another box and happy that I don't own a gun. Maybe people will read this. Maybe they won't. It doesn't matter anymore. I don't matter. I'm a waste. ",alcohol

been sober from coke almost three months now, but now i feel like my head is just on a downhill. i knew it was kinda bad but thought it was just withdrawal and it would last for a couple weeks but now it‚Äôs just harder everyday. 

i don‚Äôt have any cravings but i just feel miserable, can‚Äôt believe i let myself be in this position. my boyfriend and family don‚Äôt know about my addiction but recently i just confessed to them that i‚Äôm at my lowest 

can‚Äôt concentrate, work at all. been having suicidal thoughts on repeat everyday, today i finally reached for an appointment with the psychiatrist so i‚Äôm feeling kinda optimistic, hope everything turns out well for me.

Why can't I stop?

At this point I am starting to doubt myself, if I REALLY wanted to get over it, maybe I would have been over it by now...

I know I should not  
I do not exactly even want to get it  
do I go to rehab?  
i don't want to go to rehab I want to curb this by myself if possible  
clearly that hadn't worked out so now I am out asking for some advice.

How to quit substances? & How to prevent relapse?

One more thing if I may ask, please do not just tell me to ""stop it"" or say things like ""dont give yourself money"" please also try to give me a way to apply the suggestion practically.

I have friends who have told me to call them whenever I want to take substances, but I don't do that because idk, I feel like if i just go ahead and buy it after the call ends then it will be disrespectful to that person for some reason, plus i don't want to burden my friends about it I want to do it by myself. I won't tell my parents cuz they will just break down, can not face that.

# More context

***The substance:*** I take dxm mostly, but occassionally I might take codiene or tramdol depending on how much money I got and what is available.

Dxm is Dextromethorphan, its part of a compound they sell in syrups for dry cough.

  
***Financial aspect:*** I haven't kept track all the time but I think its easily around 10k I might have spend till date on different kinds of substances.

  
***My situation:*** I am going to start college again this year, I am just a student who isn't even that wealthy, heck even if I was I shouldn't spend my money on stupid shit like substances.

About 4 months ago now my grandfather passed away after about a years battle with lung cancer, this man was my hero, he was the first person to stand up for me when I spoke about some physical abuse I had gone through as a child, he always had time for me when I would come visit my grandparents (we lived in separate towns) , he never missed a day of work in 20 years; genuinely this man was an idol to me, a father figure where I had none. It didn‚Äôt fully click with me as I watched him take his last breath that he was never coming back but over these last few months I‚Äôm slowly spiraling as a person and I don‚Äôt know how to stop it. There has been substance abuse, an insane amount of suicidal thoughts, over drinking, not eating, chronic depression, inability to maintain relationships, inability to keep a job etc. While this is not uncommon for people with my disorder it‚Äôs been getting worse and it‚Äôs been worrying my wonderful mother, my beautiful girlfriend aswell as my friends, more so than usual. I don‚Äôt know where to go or what to do. I feel so empty inside and constantly feel the need to numb or forget about it. I tell myself he would be ashamed if he saw how I am now.

I told my bf I want to break up with him and we're having a break of a few weeks now because we never do anything except watch tv and he's always too tired to do anything or if he's not then he just doesn't want to anyway. It's something that always comes up in our relationship and I don't think sitting around watching tv half the time is helping me, and when I try and get him to do things with me he shuts it down and usually upsets me by what he says. He's always very negative about everything and since being with him I'm just not happy like I used to be. It wasn't always like this, but now he doesn't want to get married or really start our lives together like he did when we first got together three years ago. I'm the one who's always pushing the relationship and I'm really tired, though I do still love him and we do get on really well usually.

I'm also pretty stressed at work and in my personal life and I just can't seem to get a handle on things. I started a new job last year and it was a huge career change, plus I feel pressure to learn to drive and move out from my parents. I have an autoimmune disease which makes things harder for me as well and it went undiagnosed for a long time which is why I haven't been able to learn to drive or move out yet. Due to being on a temp contract for half of last year, and then being made permanent, I missed out on actually taking holiday so I had barely any time off last year and that hasn't helped. My job has also been short staffed for around half the time I've been there. I have some pets too and they take a lot of time to care for which is all adding to my stress. My bfs mum has also moved fairly close and we have to see her quite a bit which is usually one of the weekend days a couple of times a month. She is very demanding and I feel exhausted after spending a whole day with her. My own parents are hard work as my mum is an alcoholic and has mental health problems and has just been made redundant and my dad just enables her. 

I have a week off coming up and my auntie wants me to take my pets and go stay with her for a few days which I really don't want to do. I'll have to ask my sister to take me there and my little cousin always makes me really sick since he's in daycare.

I really just want to withdraw from everything and catch up on stuff in my week off and not see anyone but I don't know if that will solve anything? I feel bad because I'm supposed to go and look after my bfs mums dog this weekend with him because she's going away and she's got me food and everything, but I've already told my bf I want to have a break and that I'm not going. I'm also working overtime this weekend. 

I'm worried about withdrawing from life for a bit though, mainly because I think it will work but then in a couple of months I'll be just as stressed again and I can't keep isolating myself every few months just to cope.",withdrawal
1jb8uef,Still feel horrible after 2 months withdrawal,depression,1741971866.0,0,1,"Hi,

I was on Zoloft for 4-5 years for anxiety (which I‚Äôve had my whole life) and depression that had gotten bad during that time. It really helped me. Though, it really decreased my libido and made me numb, and was sleeping a lot. I didn‚Äôt totally feel like myself. I tried tapering off it about 2 years ago but had immediate suicide ideation and was crying all day every day. So my therapist and psychiatrist put me back on it. I felt good again. 

About a year ago, I told my psych about my negative side effects. She also put me on Wellbutrin to weigh each other out. I liked it, but it wasn‚Äôt the perfect fix. After about a year we decided to try and taper off of just the Zoloft. I was only on a small dose of 25mg at the time (had been going down in dosage over the last couple of years when being on Wellbutrin as well and trying to help my side effects of Zoloft).

It‚Äôs been 2 months off the Zoloft and I feel my depression symptoms are only getting worse. My therapist thinks I just haven‚Äôt had to deal with emotions like this in a long time and I have to work on trying to handle them all over again. I do agree with her, but every day is a struggle. I cry most days, sometimes I‚Äôm flooding myself and am laying in bed crying over nothing. I feel very depressed and irritable and unhappy about everything. I sleep a lot.

1ikclrh,Long term withdrawal symptoms,depression,1738981284.0,1,3,"Hi everyone, just want to start off by saying I'm glad this group exists. Now, I'm going to give some background on my mental history, and where I'm at now, in hopes of some advice.

I have struggled with depression all my life. I'm 31, and I started taking antidepressants about 7 years ago in 2018. That was effexor, and for the most part, it worked pretty well. The real problem was, I felt quite tired and had problems staying awake during the day, and generally just feeling very tired.

Fast forward to October of last year, and I felt stable enough in my life to try getting off the meds, to see if that may help with the tiredness. I spoke with my doctor (a general physician, not a psychiatrist) and we had a tapering plan in effect. After lowering my dosage from 150mg, to 75, then to 30, and eventually off entirely, I of course felt very sick for about a week, week and a half after stopping. I then felt really good for a while, but going on nearly 3 months from them, I'm feeling pretty awful most days.

The big problems are 1) I am having some GERD issues, and I often feel super nauseous, and like I need to vomit. There were several times when I DID vomit, but now it's just the nausea and stomach issues. 2) I'm feeling incredibly wiped, experiencing a ton of brain fog where it's hard to even think or remember things. I can of course sleep as many hours as I need, and not feel rested. I do have sleep apnea, but this feels different..(also using my CPAP for that) I have also tried to eat a healthy diet of natural and organic foods, but that doesn't seem to be helping. I also have started taking supplements such as vitamin K2, D3, Folate 15mg Plus Methyl B12 Cofactor, and a general mens multivitamin. The folate/B12 is the newest addition, as was recommended from someone in a similar situation, and it seemed like it may have helped with brain fog..but I'm still feeling tired, sick, and exasperated.

Lastly, I know symptoms are normally acute and short lived, but that it can go on for a while..my questions are:

-If you came off your antidepressants, how long did your symptoms last? (Especially curious if it was effexor/venlafaxine)
-what symptoms did you experience?
-what helped remedy these problems?

Thanks everyone for your time, it's genuinely appreciated. I am really having a hard time handling all of this, and feeling quite hopeless.",withdrawal
1irfghn,What happens when you go through withdrawal from antidepressants?,depression,1739781851.0,0,1,"One of the worst times in my life was when I went without Zoloft for almost a week because I was scared of it interacting with the meds I took for wisdom teeth surgery. I spent the days as I usually did on break, just wasting away in my room, but when I was low I was REALLY low. Incomprehensibly low. I was even more suicidal and depressed than I usually am, it constantly felt like there was something stuck in my brain causing an agonizing discomfort, and my heart kept palpitating. It was a bummer.

So that leads me to my question that I could've probably googled but couldn't phrase correctly: when Im withdrawing from a cold turkey from antideps, is the mental state caused by harm from chemical withdrawal or is it because it's the state I would be at if I never took antideps in my life?",withdrawal

eczhm3,"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?",depression,1576789860.0,376,2383,"A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition.

Good family, good friends, good country, good future ahead of me. It makes me feel worse about the feelings I‚Äôve been having lately. I‚Äôve been thinking about death, about the many, many more years I might continue living and growing on this planet, the good and the bad I will experience and wonder if any of it‚Äôs actually worth it. I look at the world and the more I do so the more it all becomes so intensely insane and draining to me. I mean what is any of this anyway? What am I? I‚Äôve tried finding meaning through various philosophical perspectives but ultimately cant find an acceptable solution to this maddening reality, it‚Äôs all just anyone‚Äôs best guess as to what it‚Äôs all about. Most nights I consider the possibility that I might not wake up the next morning, and a strange feeling of comfort comes over me, I think I would welcome death in a way like that. To finally be free in sweet oblivion. To let go. Again, I am not suicidal I don‚Äôt want to kill myself, but if something beyond my control came to take me, I think I‚Äôd be happy to go. ",suicidal

eczhm3,"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?",depression,1576789860.0,376,2386,"A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. 

Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you.",suicidal

I've also done some researches about suicide methods, but every time I read them I am afraid. Afraid of what? Of not really dying. Of a failure in that method. Of the pain or the realization of dying itself.

Edit: I am not afraid of what is afterdeath (the only thing that I know is that anything it can be, it will be better than this). I am afraid of the ACT of dying",suicidal

1igxjrt,Decided to end my life today. Take care,depression,1738610848.0,304,768,"hi, i‚Äôve (23f) decided that after typing out this post, i‚Äôm going to kill myself. I‚Äôm tired of being alone, i‚Äôm tired of being anxious/depressed, i‚Äôm tired of doing absolutely nothing with my life. I fell out with every single friend that I use to be close with and last year was one of the most loneliest years for me. I finally confessed to my parents that i need help and have been on medication ever since. I graduated from college last year as well and have been so excited to start my career. It‚Äôs been 6 months and i can‚Äôt find a job. Every job opportunity i get, falls through every. single. time. and i don‚Äôt understand why, i don‚Äôt understand why everything is so hard. Rejection after rejection after rejection. and if im not searching for damn jobs, i‚Äôm in my room all day. I sometimes try to leave the house to get some air but always end up coming back home. I only ever talk to my parents or sister (and most of the time it‚Äôs awkward because they don‚Äôt really want to conversate with me sometimes). And i force myself to hang out with boys who don‚Äôt give af about me and only want sex (just because i want someone to talk to). I always try to have hope for myself but it‚Äôs running out. I told myself that this year would be different and i don‚Äôt want to feel how i felt last year but i slowly feel myself falling back in the dark hole again and i can‚Äôt take it. I feel like im going crazy and i hate everything. I feel like im fucking suffocating and i‚Äôm so close to climbing out of the black hole, but keep getting pushed further in. I‚Äôm tired of people telling me i need to be grateful, and that i have family and a college degree and there‚Äôs no reason for me to be depressed. I‚Äôm tired of having hope for myself, just for things to go back horrible again. I hate everything and i don‚Äôt want to be here anymore. I don‚Äôt want to kill myself but i have to. I‚Äôm tired of feeling this anger, sadness, anxiousness, etc and no psychiatrist or therapist can help me anymore. I‚Äôm sorry.

I'm the problem. There's no changing my mind. We're running out of money and live in a tiny hotel room. Groceries are expensive.  I'm just so done. Nobody cares Nobody wants to help us. ",end my life
gx4ic5,"I'm black, I'm scared, tired and I'm at the end of my rope with life.",depression,1591363485.0,331,2907,"Jesus, how do I even start. As you could read by the title, I'm a black man. I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.

The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.

I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.

And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.

I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.

Edit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.

Edit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it. I love you all",end my life

Everything is much worse than before. The slightest inconvience makes me think of ending it all. I've tried 3 times and obs failed :D. I'm only 20 and I feel like an old man who has seen it all. I have had insomnia since I was a child. I can't sleep for days sometimes. It is fucked. And when I do sleep I sleep like 18 hours and still feel tired. It is very hard to keep up with my studies with this. Oh and I'm not in college but still trying to finish high school. It's not going well. I have no job and right now have about 50 bucks to live until january, after I payed my bills. I have no friends, strained relationship with family (basically just my mom, only child, father left when I was a baby) no one to talk to. No one cares about me. It's been like this all my life. Never had a single good relationship with anyone.

This all sucks but is not the why I think I will kill myself . I KNOW all of the things I could make my life go better but I just don't see it ever happening since my mental state never gets better. I've already experienced one psychotic episode. I feel constantly on the edge of sanity. I simply can't live like this much longer. There is no help for me i've tried the ""help"" so many times already. I think I will not make it to my next birthday. But that's alright, it will be a good thing for the world. I already have violent fantasies of just going to a mall and shooting people. It's best to end it before I harm somebody else. I'm not a good person and I wont be missed.

I didn't think it would get this kind of response, it was a nice suprise to wake up to since I really didn't believe there was anyone that cared anymore.

My dad located me and beat me at the time of departure at my university, he broke my glasses.
To make matters worse, next week is my graduation, I have a failed course that I have to pay for or I won't be able to graduate as an engineer.
I'd rather slit my wrists right now than see my mom disappointed in me and have her tell me ""you're still the same irresponsible guy.""
This course is not even a course that I studied, the university forces you to look for a company and work without pay for 6 months, I couldn't get a company and now I'm screwed and without money to pay for that damn course :(
I have seen my mom cry many times and it has always broken my heart, I was always taught since I was little that a man should never cry, that doing that is faggy, for the first time in my life I am venting here, I am fucked and there is no solution for this, if you read this mom: ""I'm really sorry and i love You""

Heyy

First of all, sorry if I make mistakes while writing, English is not my native language. 

F (29, almost 30). I am here because I don't know where else to go. I'm desperate. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety since my teen years. I took antidepressants for almost four years, alongside some private therapy sessions, although these were not enough because I could not afford more. However, the medication did not help at all, so I gradually stopped taking it months ago (gradually).

Everything got worse when I started feeling pain almost everyday and got diagnosed with fybromialgia, for which they prescribed me opioids. Again, they do not seem to work well for me, since the pain won't go away. I had to stop working and studying because of this. Last September, I enrolled again on uni in order to try to finish my undergraduate degree. I did my best to attend most lessons, mostly because attendance was compulsory. I was not in that much pain, but since beginning of December, I have been feeling worse and worse.  

I am in dark place right now. I barely can keep with hygiene, cannot cook (if it wasn't for my sister, I would have starved), cannot concentrate to study, don't see my friends (if I can call them that...), etc. Honestly, I feel like a burden and a complete failure. Even if my chronic illness is not a degenerative one, it affects me tremendously in all aspects of my life. If I am not able to work and the state won't give me financial aids, how am I supposed to pay for the most basic things? My parents won't be always there to help me. My father is almost 70 and my mother is ill too, she has a stage 4 lynfoma cancer and is currently receiving radiotherapy (she is stable tho and has overcome it for seven years now). Also, besides these circumstances, I hate being so dependant on them and our relationship has been problematic since my teen years too. 

I just don't see the point of living and I have not tried to end my life because of two things: I am afraid of failing and of the consequences it would have and because of how my death would affect my family and the people around me in general. 

Thank you for reading this. I appreciate any kind of support or/and help üôèüèªüíô.

34o906,"After spending a year preparing myself to go on vacation and see the only person I have ever really loved, after keeping up a long distance relationship for a year she stopped responding. And a few days ago I learned that she had died a horrible death and I can't even go to her funeral.",depression,1430611772.0,69,324,"I'm in a very weird position right now, and I really need to vent. Because I haven't been able to get out of bed for the past few days. You don't have to read this story (its long), but I really just need to let this out.

So, to preface this, I am in college right now, and every year since I was young I have been going to the middle east, and spending time with my family over the summer. Last summer I met a girl, who I connected with more than anybody I had ever met. As an anti-social, frankly ugly person I had never been great with women, never had a girlfriend, or a friend who is a girl. 

But this girl was beautiful and funny, not that smart but amazing. Really amazing. I spent the entire rest of my vacation with her. She was my very first girlfriend, my first kiss, my first lover. But, I had school so I had to leave, I spent one last night with her and promised to keep in touch. And I did. 

Everyday after classes I'd send her a message on WhatsApp and ask her how she was. She meant so much to me, and I felt like I wasn't worthy, so I started working out, tried to improve my Arabic, and took care of myself for once. She pushed me the entire way, talking with me on Skype and really making me better. I believed she was an angel sent to save my life, and in many ways she was. 

But a week ago, she stopped responding to my messages. I thought she had gotten bored of me, I thought the worst. And then the worst happened.

I offhandedly asked my relative in Lebanon what had happened to her. She sighed and sadly told me that she had moved away. I knew she was lying from the tone of her voice and pressed it. Which now I regret... a whole lot. 

She told me that this girl, my first motivation and first love had been murdered. She had been raped and killed, and found dead in an alley. I was so horrified I closed the phone and began to cry. I went to bed, crying. slept for 3 hours and woke up soaked in my own tears. Then I stayed in bed and haven't gone to my classes since. I've laid in bed not talking to anyone and I feel like I'm dying slowly. 

Even now I'm crying, feeling empty inside. Feeling like my heart is shuddering with every breath. I have a constant sense of despair in my stomach. And I keep sending her messages hoping that this is some sort of cruel joke on my relatives part. My parents have come by and tried to comfort me but have given up. My best friend has tried to console me but he isn't the touchy feely type to  begin with. I don't know why I wrote this, but I really need to vent, to get this out of my head before I go back to school tommorow. 

I'm sorry for the novel, thanks for reading if you got this far.

I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.

The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.

I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.

And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.

I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.

Edit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.

Edit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it. I love you all",i cant go on

1ihsagw,I feel no reason to live.,depression,1738702669.0,1,1,"24F. Graduated university 6 months ago. 

Looking for a job and not finding one. 

Must leave homecountry because I have serious problems living in it.

Parents don't give a fuck, they just let me do whatever I do in my room all day (nothing + job search). 

I thought I'd find a job and just leave the country and finally be happy that I leave my shitty parents.

But I suddently don't want to anymore. Because I feel depressed. The only friends I had were cats that I feed in the countryside (where I go sometimes, at one of my parent's house). but I realized I can't take a cat with me when I'm gone. I can't handle it financially/psychologically. 

But without this ""warm"" presence in my life (the cat's presence) I cannot go on. 

I try to spend most of the time at the other parent's house (the one without cats), applying for jobs.

But I end up crying every day and feeling like shit.

I can't stay where I am (in the same city, same country) cause I am very different and feel stared at and harassed and left out for what I look like. My dream would be to live somewhere where (mostly) no one cares about your origins.

But I feel like I can't do this.

I've lost any spark.

1ekdsow,Is there a reason to live if you missed out on your teens and 20s and had no friends growing up?,depression,1722828169.0,12,36,"I really feel there's no point to life now because I missed out on the normal childhood friendships and experiences that most people have. I'm autistic and didn't know how to really make friends with other kids, and they mostly left me out of everything so I never had real friends. I get really upset by all these coming-of-age movies or TV shows that are about normal kids who have a bunch of friends to grow up with, or from reading people's stories online where they talk about the friends they had in high school and how they couldn't have made it without them. Stories like the Goonies or Stranger Things really make me upset because of the chemistry between those kids, you can really tell how close they are but I never had a friend smile at me or hug me like they do, and I hate how those stories just assume everyone has it that good growing up.

It feels like I missed out on too much, like I'll never know what it's like to be a normal kid and have friends to celebrate with on your birthday or help you with your problems, or getting invited to the prom or having fun at summer camp, the mall, the movies, etc. It makes me really jealous of normal people because it feels like I'm outside humanity. When I graduated high school I didn't feel good, it just meant I failed to do anything with my teenage years and I've only gotten more isolated and hopeless since then. The only thing I want now is to go back in time or be reborn as a normal kid who can actually have friends growing up, but if I'll never know what it's like to have friends to grow up with then I don't see why I should get any older.",no reason to live

After 10th I‚Äôm living out of home so we were in long distance relationship, so talked on chat and vdo calls.. I deeply fell in love. I barely talk to papa or mummy, it‚Äôs like once in a week with mummy and once in a month with papa. I didn‚Äôt make friends as I always think if she is there I need no friends I talk with her 3-4 hrs daily on average share everything and she too. From last 1-2 years I really loved her more than anyone, more than my parents. and Gradually decided everything with her about my future, about marriage and all, was collecting some money for a ring.

from last 1yr I daily think about my future concerned how I‚Äôll make money and will make her parents agree for marriage. But with allll this I felt like I‚Äôm being over possessive with her, felt like she does not love me like i do. I felt she should treat me love me just as much as I love her, when I be sad I expect her to at least talk about that but I see she is happy with her friends and I talked several times with her about this that it hurts and she tried to make everything normal but her efforts didn‚Äôt seem enough . I spent nights reading her chats and she was with her friends happy I felt worse and this thing happened to me 10-12 times.

I understand she has her own life to live and enjoy too but the possessiveness the care I had I wanted that from her side too idk why. I wanted her to be with me just like how I‚Äôm there for her when needed, I compared her with my love, I become very very over possessive.

on 24th September when I saw her photo with a male friend of her, again I compared and cried a lot thinking that just talking to other girls make her sad so I didn‚Äôt talked to any girl in my life and she made a friend. I ended up using abusive words as I feel like I lost my mind. And that was the worst day of my life.

She blocked me, from everywhere.

I realised that I have done absolute wrong with her and cried like a baby thinking what I have done to my relationship. I wrote a letter about that moment, I literally felt like nothing was is in my control I was how mad at that moment, I sent the letter to her but no response, called with friends numbers cried in front of her and told her everything that I‚Äôll not do ever anything like that. But she was in so much anger that she didn‚Äôt even listen to my words carefully, I emailed her so many times so much of sorry, apologies. I went to her college gate but she didn‚Äôt come, second time she came and said I don‚Äôt want to live with you i cried their told her if she gives me 5minutes a day i'm ok with that too but she denied, I felt devastated and returned with a broken heart somehow managed to come to my hostel, some days later I went to her station and spent 3-4 starving days and nights there, emailed her and waited for her reply. She didn‚Äôt reply. Again managed to come hostel with a broken heart din't get that how can she be so rude with me. But how can i give up, i emailed her so many times, wrote a whole poem for her sent her with friends numbers but againnnnn no reply. I hurt myself with blades send her photos but no response from her.



Now I get to know that she has moved on and with someone else. Wow. I am shivering. Is this real? This also happens? I was everything to her. She is everything to me. How can this happen? We have promised 5 whole years that anything happens we‚Äôll understand each other and still love each other.She is my world, have I lost it? How will I make understand myself about this. Every time when I felt bad I went to her, and she too.This is what happens at last? If this world is like this then why should I live here?



Why shouldn‚Äôt I die. The only person I trust does this then how can I trust anyone? I love her. Isn‚Äôt this enough to come back. There is no reason in me to live more. There is no motivation.  I was living for a good life with her, had so many dreams, every dream was with her. Every second I‚Äôm feeling is like a burden on my heart, all moments coming on eyes.

A couple days after that, I ended up catching Covid for the first time, and despite how badly it ravaged my already weakened mind/body, I still couldn't turn to anyone for any sort of comfort/support, because I'm alone. And in the same week that both of these awful things happened, my birthday also took place, but nobody noticed or cared, because I'm alone. For weeks afterwards I suffered terribly from long Covid and additional seizures of the focal variety, and throughout it all, I could only lay there, arms wrapped around my own body, whispering whatever little comfort I could give to myself, like a man freezing in the dark clinging to a tattered blanket for warmth. 

In the past, I used to have a couple people I spoke with online, but depression and the assortment of other mental illnesses I suffer from made me isolate myself completely. I've never had any IRL friends. 

Now, after everything that's happened to me this past month, I feel like I'm scrambling all at once to try and reach out to other people, and I'm glad to say that I've met a couple nice individuals this way, but they can only talk to me so much, and for most of the day I just sit completely alone in my room, lonely and scared like I've never been before. What's worse though, is how the more I need other people, the more that pushes them away. I don't want to be a buzzkill, or desperate, or clingy, or needy, but it's really hard not to be when you're in a crisis, yet regardless that doesn't make it any less repellent.   

If I were a normal person, unburdened by chronic depression, I could've at least had good friends and a loving partner to help me through this whole ordeal, but instead I've had to largely go through it alone. Because I've always been so depressed and neurotic, I haven't had the ability to form any sort of connections to other people. This right here is the worst trap life can set for you, since once a crisis hits you, especially of the medical variety, you have no one else other than yourself to see you through it, and let me tell you, that just isn't enough.

Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.
I‚Äôm a 20yo man. I‚Äòm Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.
I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I‚Äôll call her Honey in this post.
 So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.
When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to ¬´¬†flirt¬†¬ª. Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren‚Äôt as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.
We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it‚Äôs so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more ¬´¬†serious¬†¬ª¬†(important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn‚Äôt agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.
Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it‚Äôs unusual.
But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that clich√© of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‚Äòd have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.
We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn‚Äôt the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.
When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.
We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn‚Äôt stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I‚Äôd even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I‚Äôve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I‚Äôve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.
Everyone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.
I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‚Äòm not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.
We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it‚Äôd have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved.  But I cannot bear what happened.
We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way.  No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it‚Äôs extremely harsh.
It was a Sunday and we were at our parents‚Äô for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.
On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents‚Äô and me at mine, there wasn‚Äôt even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more.  It‚Äôs absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‚Äòd never forgive myself.
It‚Äôs an ongoing case so I‚Äôm not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn‚Äôt have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).
I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.
Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn‚Äôt prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‚Äòll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.
I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.
I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.
Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it‚Äôs because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.
People tell me that one day when I‚Äôll be happy again and I‚Äòll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it‚Äôs wrong, first I‚Äòll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it‚Äôs unbearable to survive since she‚Äòs no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn‚Äôt now that I‚Äòm desperate without her that I‚Äòll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‚Äòll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I‚Äôm ¬´¬†relieved¬†¬ª that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.
Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don‚Äôt see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very ¬´¬†strong¬†¬ª and now I‚Äòm extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‚Äòre also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.
The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‚Äòll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).
I‚Äôm not afraid of the judgement, I know they‚Äòll have a long sentence but I‚Äòm very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‚Äòre going to say, I‚Äòm anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I‚Äôm trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn‚Äôt want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it‚Äôs, when I‚Äôm there I feel calmer.

Hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you <3

I know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. 

My parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth.

My friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves.

It's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together.

School is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying ""mental health matters guys!"" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say ""its really important we look after our wellbeing"" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and ""talking to someone"", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to ""look after our wellbeing"" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time.

I have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat.

Theres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life. There is no place in the world for people like me.",life is unbearable

15zzcnk,Life with anxiety is becoming unbearable,depression,1692876669.0,0,2,"Hi everybody! This past few years were definitely the hardest on me. Ever since I turned 20 (now 24) I have only been confronted with situations that made my anxiety spiral. I try to challenge myself in life but by trying new things I actually just end up giving up on it beause it puts a terrible strain on me. For example wanting to do volontary work abroad, university studies, trying a new workplace or I tried to own a pet twice now but due to terrible anxious reactions I had to give them back after a few days. My anxiety manifests by having terrible stomach pain that makes me vomit and prevents me from sleeping days on end, it continues with panic attacks, diarrhea, weight loss and so on. Everytime I start to challenge myself I have to cancel that experience in order to lessen my anxiety again, but at the same time I miss on so many opportunities I desperately want to achieve. This pain is really becoming unbearable and I feel like I am putting a big strain on my family. Especially due to this recent event of adopting a kitten and now being able to take care of it because my overthinking is turning me incredibly sick. I am aware that the act is terrible and I have put my family through unnecessary pain. I feel like a monster that is a huge burden to others and it‚Äòs really getting worse as time goes on. I am in psychotherapy, have visited psychiatrists before and have been prescribed xanax. I am feeling like a failure and really need some guidance on how to handle this.",life is unbearable

In comparison to the majority of people on this platform, my condition is most likely not even worth mentioning, quite frankly, since it isn't that bad, but I still wanted to get an outside perspective.

Generally speaking, I am not concerned about attempting self-harm or committing suicide currently. At least, not yet. My mental health is deteriorating, so it might worry me in the foreseeable future, but I have so far never gotten any thoughts of harming myself or ending it all. 
 Please offer me advice or opinions on what to do moving forward.

Here are my symptoms:

Excessive guilt, Reminiscing the past, Lack of motivation, Overthinking, Binge eating, Always tired, Intrusive thoughts, Low self-esteem, Highly sensitive to criticism or anything deemed less than perfect, and Easily tearful.

Hormones and stress are also causes for some of these, not just depression, but I believe there is at least a somewhat correlation between these signs and my worsened depression.

At the end of the day, I am just a kid trying to fix my issue before adulthood arrives, so any assistance or support y'all can offer is much appreciated by me.

Depression made me dumb, uninteresting, made me stop reading books, made me stop learning, caused me to spend days like a zombie, caused me amnesia, literally caused my brain to shrink. But the worst was the effect it had after 15 years of fucking my brain. Now I lost my mind. Now i lost that quirky weird fun personality. Now i have lost the cultured nerd that i used to be. I had to grow up getting bullied for being a nerd, for being weird, for not poisoning my mind with mindless activities and TV.

Then I grew up and I lost all of those qualities that were supposed to make me have a cool life and cool friends finally. I wanted to be in the art community, going to talks and book readings and exhibitions and come back from it open a bottle of wine and drink it around the aged wooden table which stands in the middle of the living room that is surrounded by weird and classic paintings, contemporary sculptures and talk about philosophy. I was supposed to be the cultured smart weird but interesting guy. I WAS THAT GUY. I was born to be that guy.

But depression fucked me. And for the past 5 years I had set the goal to become that person again. The real me. But i have not only failed but I have rotten even further. Depression is a disease and has to be dealt with early on, otherwise there's no point in living like a half vegetable, high on antidepressants during the day and sleeping while on benzos at night.

I lost 2 women I truly loved due to my depression. Due to them thinking that I was that cultured smart creative and deep thinker, only to find out I had nothing to talk about, I wasn't able to form arguments, wasn't able to debate on topics, hadn't read many books, didn't know anything about art or culture and was simply boring and dumb to them. It's my worst nightmare come true. People ditching and telling me I'm uninteresting. This was NOT SUPPOSED TO BE my life. I deserved to be loved and experience that love with her after years of patience, years of pain and sorrow. I persevered. I don't accept this anymore. I tried to change but it doesn't work. I can't read anymore. My brain is fucked and I've literally lost so many IQ points that i don't understand what people tell me. My brain is too slow. And while reading i forget the sentences i read after a couple of seconds so I can't connect them and comprehend the story. I live in the moment. I can only hold 5 seconds of life in my mind. I lost my creativity. My ability to imagine and see while my eyes are closed.

Oh my god we would have been so perfect for each other. She is my female version. I am her. And she is exactly the person I wanted to be. Maybe that's why I love her so much. And as mad and hurt as I am for the way she treated me, I really can't blame her for not wanting me. I wouldn't want this ""me"" either. But it hurts so much because i know how i used to be. I know how my life would have turned out without the depression. Its so fucking painful. A family member killed himself a couple of years ago and that was less painful. It was shocking but this daily constant pain, this living through my nightmares is unbearable.

Anyways she has had a few attempts in the past with pills. As soon as she received the pills she told me that she felt anxious that she was going to do something stupid and that she doesn't trust herself around them. 

She had an idea that she would take one when it is prescribed and put the rest in water and freeze it so she wouldn't have quick access to it if she wants to take more than prescribed.

1ipgi6z,I don't want to live anymore because of the overwhelming pain but I don't have the courage to end my life,SuicideWatch,1739555670.0,0,3,"I've been diagnosed with major depression disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, and OCD a few years ago. Over the years, I've also had multiple relapses of severe depression despite already taking the highest dosage of anti-depressants. I often struggle to find the will to keep living when I'm just in constant pain (grieve, regret) during these major relapses.

Often, I would fantasise about ending my life to finally free myself from the pain, yet did not find the courage to proceed because of my fear of physical pain (especially if the suicide attempt failed) and the uncertainty of death. Furthermore, since young, society has always taught us that suicide is morally wrong and even criminal in my country. As such, often times, I find myself living (and not ending my life) not because I want to live, but simply because deep down, a part of me still feels that suicide is morally wrong especially when everyone keep telling me that it is not the solution and I am just escaping the problem. However, another part of me is sick of the constant grief that feels like my heart is being stabbed and ripped from my chest 24/7 and a constant sinking feeling that sucks all joy and happiness out of you. I get urges to take the knife and kill myself (and take the knife when no one is around to stop me) and when my hurt and pain is too overwhelming but I never had the courage to actually do it. 

I had even taken several months of break from school and work because of my mental health struggles. Things seemed to be going in the right direction until some friendship drama recently that resulted in former friends not just cutting ties but me losing the opportunity to engage in the activity that bring me greatest joy because some drama happened and people complained me for unsolicited trauma dumping (I was totally unaware until I got banned from the club which I had experience ostracism and harassment form some members the past year). I felt totally betrayed, hurt, and wronged and nothing I did could savage this situation. It feels like all hope is lost and I often wonder what's the point of even continuing on in life.

I feel that the world is against me, no one would even care when I die, and honestly, what's the point of living when I'm just going to be in constant pain?",overwhelmed

Weekend. I don't know. She did drugs. She drank. Gargantuan amounts.

My Dad shot himself one night 5 years ago in a parking lot. He was an amazing person. I know what all was wrong. I haven't figured a single thing out. I never will. THat's just how that shit goes.

She ruined the lives of those close to her.. But she also made everyone else so happy. so it's so hollow in here hurting and knowing.

She did drugs. She smoked meth. She smoked crack. She hid it, covered it, covered it with haha smoking weed, to my naive mother. My mother says she had no idea. ""She wasn't drinking"". Anymore. No, she was... whatever all those little rose vials and glass tubes and butane lighters we're for, and why she couldn't wake up last Christmas Eve and slept thru Morning and why she fought us all, and blamed us all for everything, and told us what was all wrong with each of us, and how we were fucking up, and how we were shitty, and how we were the ones hurting HER.

Fuck, I'm so angry and upset and just spiraling.

Fuck me. Fuck this. What am I doing.  
Because I want someone to tell me I'm okay. I'll be okay. That I should keep being here.

I am spiraling. I am out of fuel. I am only here to keep my mother alive. My life is pointless.

1jl1b3s,I'm just a worthless leech to society...,SuicideWatch,1743073424.0,2,24,"As the title says, I'm just an angry, depressed, lazy, and worthless leech to society. Over the past few years, I've turned into a really nasty person and I'm at the point to where nothing really brings me joy anymore and everything is just hopeless. 

I lost my mom in April 2019, 3 weeks before my high school graduation. I was devastated and my mental health went on a steep decline. Had to move to my grandparents on my mom's side, which weren't really emotionally supportive and would often ridicule me for behaving a certain way. 

Then my brother, who is my half brother, had to move across the country to live with his abusive dad because he was a minor at the time and the courts ruled that he should be with his father. Knowing what his dad did to my mom, it's sickens me to think about the fact that he has my brother now. But maybe I'm just overreacting because he seems to be doing well. 

Went to college in the fall semester and things went left quickly. I was so depressed that I didn't bother showing up to classes, I would spend my financially refund on a bunch of junk food just to keep my mind occupied from the depression. I was also a huge slob and would barely clean up my room, to the point where I would have my RA constantly held me for having a dirty dorm, as well as my roommate who would complain to me about the very same thing. I just didn't care about anything. 

Often posted about how suicidal I was on social media to the point where police would regularly knock on my door to check on me. Now, every time someone knocks, I can't help but feel my heart begin to race rapidly. 

Covid hit and eventually I had to move back to my grandparents, who we're still emotionally unsupportive and constantly Express how lazy I am for not getting a job, which is fair and all honesty but it didn't make me feel good at the time. It got to where the environment just got two toxic, but I couldn't go back to school because my grades were so low after that spring semester that I lost my scholarships and couldn't go back to my university. 

So in 2021, I told him that I would be moving back to my school but instead I just moved away from my grandparents and took a bus to a different city and stayed at a homeless shelter there. Eventually my dad found me and wanted me to move in with him, which I was hesited at first because it didn't know my dad very well (it took him 13 years to get the milk) but knowing that I had no other option I went with him. Gave me a year to save up enough money to get into my own apartment. Then when time was up, I told him that I found an apartment but I really didn't because I would spend all of my paycheck within the weekend ordering DoorDash and Uber Eats.

Dad eventually found out about it and told my grandparents who were also disappointed, let me stay in his residence for another year but with stricter rules. Rules that I honestly didn't like because it made me feel like a child. Then one day, my dad just went missing. Stop showing up to work, stopped coming home, no one knew where he was. His phone cut off, his bosses couldn't find them, no one. I was living in his apartment and because he pays most of the rent and bills there, I knew I couldn't stay there for long so I found a room to stay in at a house. 

Of course, my grandparents were worried but also kind of blamed his disappearance on me. Then started blaming me for other stuff that was unrelated to the disappearance. To be fair, at this point I'm a compulsive liar, so maybe it was deserved but I ended up cutting my extended family off after being told that I've done nothing with my life ever since I graduated high school. I've wasted 4 years of my life  accomplishing nothing. It set me off so bad to the points of where I just ended contact with them. 

So after a year, in 2024 at this point, I started applying the jobs because the job that I was at sucked. I found a job and even had orientation set up and everything, but I messed up because I couldn't find my ID and I needed my ID for I-9 documents. So instead of showing up to my new job explaining to them about the situation, I ended up not going and completely wasting the new opportunity I was given. At the time, I had also put in my two weeks and my first day of my new job was the day after the last day of my old job. Eventually I ran out of money and had to move out of the room that I was staying in, leaving me homeless for about 5 months. 

At first I kind of accepted that this was my life, and that's I would never go anywhere, but then silly old me decided to get help and got accepted into a rapid rehousing program which was cool. I could finally make progress in my life and work towards getting into the tech field. 

Fast forward to now, and I have barely made any progress with anything. Work is so hard to find and consistently waking up to denied job applications and not making money became tiring. Also, experiencing more mental health issues, which I've come to accept as a part of me now. 

Normally I would just soak and mope about the bleak situation that I'm in now, but then recently I started to realize that I kind of had this coming to me. I've lied to people multiple times. I have emotionally hurt people and push people away because of my suicidal ideation. I'm also lazy because there's some opportunities that I could have taken but just didn't. Also, I'm trying to get into a field that is becoming more and more oversaturated without even a college degree. Lately I've just been thinking of myself, I'm fucked. And maybe that's for the better. 

I've noticed in life that I can't just keep blaming things on other events. Yes, my mom's passing was a tragedy, but everything after that was kind of my fault. I was the one who flunked myself out of university, after getting full ride scholarships. I was the one who lied to my family over and over again. I was the one who stayed in a shitty dead end job doing shit that I hated. I was the one who got myself homeless, and for the record I've been homeless multiple times at this point. I am the one who isn't getting employed, and keeps backing out on opportunities more employment. I've come to realize, I'm the problem. I just can't seem to hardwire my brain into fixing the problems and doing what I need to do. 

Honestly? A part of me is fine with this. I don't think I was meant to be successful in the first place. Success isn't even possible for me anymore, and it's totally my fault. I accept that it's my fault. I pushed away all my friends and family, I'm all alone and I just don't have anyone who I can really trust anymore. Therapy doesn't work. Making friendships doesn't work. I don't feel comfortable with anyone anymore. I kind of had this coming for a while. My situation is just the result of all of my mistakes in the past.

The worst part is, there are two ways that I can fix it. I can fix it by either going through with my plans to become successful and eventually be a functioning member society, or I can go through with the suicidal ideation that's been in my head for years now. I'm too lazy to do the former and too much of a coward to do the latter. So I'm just left with the third option: to just stop crying about it and accept it.

A part of me doesn't even want to be successful anymore. I feel like there were some things that I didn't have to stress about well being homeless. When you're at rock bottom and have nothing to lose, it's hard to really feel stressed. It's a feeling of ""I know my place"", If that makes sense. 

Also, with my extreme anxiety and major depressive disorder, I don't think this world is meant for people like me anyway. I hate saying that out loud because it sounds like an excuse, but when it gets to where both disorders are severely impacting me to the point of deabilitation, I have to start questioning things. How can I survive in a world like this? I can't. Everything is too overwhelming for me. Everything is just too much for me to handle, and I feel like someone like me just isn't meant to be a functioning member of society. I'll be a leash until the day I die. It's an unfortunate reality, but it's something that I need to embrace and accept.

1ivu7k3,My friend might accidentally kill himself and I can't cope,SuicideWatch,1740261417.0,1,1,"# TW: SELFHARM

My best friend is the single funniest, most talented, kindest, and most mentally ill person I know.

He is a severe cutter, like more severe than I ever thought was possible. Tonight he wants to go for something that he finally feels is ""enough"", but I'm so sure it's going to kill him. He wants to cut all the way across his upper thigh, exposing the fascia in the process, and I *know* he's going to accidentally hit his femoral artery.

He doesn't believe me when I say his self-harm is the most severe I have ever seen, he doesn't believe me when I say his self-harm could actually kill him, and he doesn't believe me when I say that this cut is something suicidal, instead he believes that he has ""never come close"" to dying from this and that he'll ""be safe"". He assures me that he wants to live, and I believe him, but I also believe he's too mentally ill to understand the gravity of his addiction.

I don't want his last minutes to be spent feeling so so so fucking scared as he realizes how bad his self harm actually was, and the thought of that being a real possibility is making me physically sick. He doesn't deserve that.

I KNOW for a fact how important close relationships and love is to me, but that doesn't mean I want some rando to love me just to feel good.

As if feeling alone and lacking love isn't enough, whenever I express this, no one else gets it except for maybe 2 people and AI chat lmao. There's always some unsolicited advise about how I should be happy single (as if I wasn't single my entire life), not be dependent on relationships (again, never dated and I don't want a relationship just for the sake of it. Imagine the feeling of missing someone, not the feeling of being in love with love), how I should just embrace other forms of love, replace love with something else like work, or ""buT yoUr neGatiVity wiLl beCome a seLf-fuLling proPhecy"" (as if positive thinking did me any good üôÑ and plenty of people that were down or gave up found love). 

I know if I had everything else in the world- clout, money, fame, etc. I would still be miserable without fully being able to share my love with someone that sees my worth. Even if I loved myself and saw my worth, there would still be a void in me. 

If I still have the same naive hope for love, I'll end up disappointed year after year. I feel like I'll be 35, still single, definitely wanting to kill myself but I'll be conviced to have hope only to wake up 10 years later in the same position. 

Even self love isn't enough to keep me alive because without someone to share it with, it gets old and stale. It's like my only options are to live a miserable, lonely life that I have to accept and learn to be content with or kill myself early enough so I don't have to suffer. Anyone that says anything to the tune of ""relationships aren't everything"" will be ignored or met with ""üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ"" because I already know you don't get it. All the cliche advice won't work here because they don't address the real issues.",i cant cope

Basically, I have autism, which was undiagnosed until I was 15.
My childhood was okay, other than being an anxious kid there wasn‚Äôt really anything else out of the ordinary. But shit really hit the fan in puberty. I couldn‚Äôt cope with the increasing social pressure, sensory overload and intense anxiety, I also developed an eating disorder. I went years without any help, basically just being called over-dramatic or a bitch whenever I tried to express how bad I felt. I got to a point where I couldn‚Äôt attend school anymore, I was completely burned out and actively suicidal.
This lead to me getting my autism diagnosis. But all the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù I basically got was a detailed schedule for the whole day (which was just more demands in a period where I couldn‚Äôt do any demands!!). I ended up getting sent away to a treatment facility for teens and young adults with various mental health conditions, and that was hellish!! It wasn‚Äôt like a mental hospital, it was kinda a care place where you would live, and while it had its upsides, it certainly also had many many downsides. The place brimmed with very troubled teens, like I‚Äôm talking serious self harm, hard drug use, police Involvements, stuff of that nature, it was seriously traumatic, but I had nowhere else to go. My parents only saw me as a problem, a burden‚Ä¶ when I turned 18 I asked them if I could move back, but they said I was too ‚Äúold‚Äù. So I moved to another place, a less hellish place luckily, but it still wasn‚Äôt optimal.
When I turned 20 I finally moved out by myself, and I have lived by myself since (I‚Äôm 23 now). Things are sorta okay, I‚Äôm getting my education, and I‚Äôm trying to be healthy and all that. But I just get so overwhelmed and haunted by those 5 years of my youth, and I just know it‚Äôll follow me for the rest of my life, I just can‚Äôt take it, I really fucking hate it. I seriously just want to end it all, I feel like I‚Äôm too broken at this point to even try to have a normal life. ",i cant cope

1jmht26,"Broken after a terrible life, want to give up",SuicideWatch,1743236852.0,4,1,"My (41 F) life in a nutshell:

I grew up in a dysfunctional family with physical and mental abuse. Was bullied at school. Started drinking and taking drugs as a teenager.

In my mid-twenties, I found a spiritual community that helped me out of that lifestyle and a few years later, I left my home country and moved to a place where this community is more active. Lost contact with all of my old friends.

Have always been struggling to fit into society, dropped out of university and got a job but burnt out in my early 30's. Was diagnosed with autism and adhd around that time. Also ended up homeless, was moving around a lot between 2014 and 2018 with no place to rest while also suffering from major depression and serious fatigue. Got no support from my family, they only carried on with the mental abuse so I cut off ties with them.

Got disability pension 2018 at the age of 35. Found a decent place to live but also isolated myself totally since then. Was in a destructive relationship, ended it in late 2019 since he threatened to beat me up and kill me. Then the pandemic happened and I got even more isolated.

Left the spiritual community last year since I found out they're a cult; got no real support from them whatsoever, they just manipulated me into thinking that all negative things happening to me are my own fault and result of my past actions, and there was nothing I could do about it and that I was on my own. Got contact with some cult survivor groups and made close friends with one person online. Soon we developed romantic feelings to each other and since a couple of months or so we've been in a long distance relationship. He's been my everything since then but just like me, he suffers from ptsd and has since 10 days or so behaved very weirdly. Isolated from the rest of the world, hardly responding to my messages and when he does, it takes nearly one day or so.

I think I'm having a mental breakdown, I'm nearly suicidal. What's the point of going on with life? It's only been a series of tragedies and I seem to make terrible mistakes all the time. Have zero friends I can rely on and I'm too broken to make it on my own. Thought that me and my boyfriend (or maybe I should consider myself single at this point?) would have supported each other and start a new life together but it seems he's not on the same page anymore. I just can't cope with him disappearing, not giving me any kind of validation or showing any signs that he wants to communicate with me and sort things out. So on top of all this, my heart's also broken now.

After a life like this, how can I carry on without family or friends or anyone to rely on? I just want to give up",broken

I want to tell my story, the whole story at least once before I go. I never told anyone my truth because I was protecting some image I wanted to live up to. This post is going to seem very self righteous, but I've never told my story. To anyone. I was an attractive, smart, athletic young man born into the worst circumstances someone can be born into. My Mom was a mentally ill narcissistic hoarder and my Dad a broken alcoholic. I lived in filth my entire life, and my parents never cared about actually raising me and instead kinda just expected me to raise myself in a terrible environment. And they actively tried to hide how bad things were the few times they were questioned which shows me they knew what they were doing on some level. My biggest regret is never telling anyone how bad my home life was, because I probably could've made something of myself had I been raised in an even semi normal household. That's the hardest part. I was gonna go more in depth but it seems futile and pointless honestly. Imagine a filthy home with no love in it at all, being socially isolated for your first 13 years of life out of fear they'd lose me (which they would've if anyone knew how bad it was) and constant blame being thrown on you. I remember crying and begging my mom to clean and her yelling at and blaming me, an 8 year old at the time, for the entire state of the home. It's beyond fucked up. I'm just glad I got to experience love a few times, even though I was too broken to love them properly in return. I'm glad I got to experience real friends for a while before I lost them because again, I'm broken.. I really am.. I never knew what love looked like, but it was shown to me a few times by some beautiful people along my journey. I tried my best to be a good person but I fundamentally didn't know how to be because I was raised like an animal.

Try hard in everything you do, put your best foot forward, love fiercely, love deeply, enjoy the people around you, take opportunities when they are given to you no matter how scared you are, open up to people because there's some beautiful souls along the way, and don't let anyone tell you your limit because as long as you have love around you anything is possible.

I have a robust social life. I do pretty good at school and I‚Äôm about to graduate. But I just don‚Äôt care about any of that anymore! I struggle to reconcile with the abuse I faced as a child. Both of my parents and even my abuser expect me to simply move on past it because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an adult now‚Äù in their words. But even though I have found it in my heart to forgive, that anger is still there, and I still feel hatred and sadness and resentment for the conditions for which I and my brother suffered under. I dread the feeling of waking up every day to another trudge through being alive in a world I want nothing to do with.

My mom said something to me today the likely never forget. She told me that she had already buried me in her mind, because after I had tried to kill myself one too many times in my youth, she had to focus more on my brother because at least he was probably going to live even if I didn‚Äôt. That hurt me. Particularly because she had never been emotionally available enough to help me process through those emotions I held about myself and my existence. In her words, she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know what to do with me.‚Äù 

I remember when I was in the hospital after one suicide attempt. She was apparently in another state and then flew all the way from that state just to see me. But the first words that came out of her mouth, was her calling me selfish.. Although her use of the term selfish doesn‚Äôt mean anything to me anymore‚Ä¶. She‚Äôs used that term so long to tug on my heart strings to keep me here, that it‚Äôs lost its magic on me. In my death I can afford be selfish because the dead don‚Äôt have the capacity to care.

Three weeks ago My apartment was broken into by 4 strangers, my girlfriend was sleeping over. It was an awful, horrific long night, and she witnessed every single thing. 8 hours of prolonged humiliation and abuse.

These 4 strangers destroyed me. They shredded every bit of self-esteem and sanity I had. After the hell they put me through, they simply left me there. bleeding heavily and stunned. My girlfriend was tied up screaming, but I didn't move. It took me a while to comprehend that this is now my reality and eventually get up.

Weeks later, I am paranoid, unable to look at my reflection without feeling disgust, and I spend my time in my university lectures thinking about ending my life. I didn't tell a single soul about this because I feel so ashamed. I feel pathetic and weak. My girlfriend is the only one that knows, though everyone around has been telling me I've been ignoring them lately and calling me an asshole for it, yet I don't care. I just feel numb. I want to die, but I'm too afraid to say it out loud. That night they not only violently violated me, but they took something from me, a piece of my soul.

Anyways, ever since that night my girlfriend has been acting different. she treats me differently, touches me differently, and most importantly she looks at me differently. A few days ago while we were sitting together, she told me that it's alright if this experience turns me ""gay"" and that we don't have to continue dating. this is coming from a 19 year old girl that has common sense, it all just made me feel really bad. It just reflected how after all this, how disgusting I feel was valid, that I am gross in her eyes now.

Today is my birthday, I turn 20. I bailed on all the plans and decided to spend it alone. I'm sitting at home drinking alcohol and thinking about bashing my goddamn face in. I just feel alone in a way I never felt before. I just never thought this is where I'd be, that this would be my life.

I hope I'm posting this in the correct place, I've only had Reddit when I was younger. thanks for listening for whoever is out there. Hopefully I'll feel better for writing this.

UPDATE 1:
Two of the assailants were caught by the police today. I‚Äôll post a more detailed update in the next few days. 
Thank you everyone for this support.

UPDATE 2:
sorry I‚Äôm late with this, I‚Äôve just been going through a lot. I‚Äôm gonna try to give everyone a bit of closure on everything that‚Äôs went down. 
The four assailants were part of a sex trafficking gang that my shitty dad got involved with and owed a lot of money. I‚Äôm not comfortable sharing the details of this specific aspect, but I hope this general explanation is enough. 
Two of them were caught and will be most likely going to prison as they plead guilty to avoid a trial. 
I‚Äôm currently trying to get myself together, but things have been getting worse and worse mentally. I‚Äôve been going to gym, jogging and trying my best to not lose it, I didn‚Äôt start therapy, but I‚Äôm considering it. 

Me and my girlfriend broke up and there‚Äôs no bad blood. I just need to focus on myself. 

And again, thank you everyone for the immense support you‚Äôve given me. You have no idea how much it saved me and made me feel a little less alone. Thank you.",at my wits end

But I've come to terms that I wanted us to try again after breaking up years ago. We've talked almost every single day. I was her only strong connection outside family. But she worked on her business, her animals, her hobbies. I meanwhile was stuck in a retail job , burnt out and constantly in a cycle of wanting to improve health, improve depression and anxiety, find friends and wanting to enjoy things again. Except I didn't do anything for 5 years. Every year it was I'm gonna get better, and shed be happy for me. And we'd meet up a couple times a year and spend a long time together and I would feel a slight pang of wanting more but squashed it because I knew I wasn't ready for her. She sought out therapy, and at some point she made the decision to no longer wait for me and instead find new connections. And she's got that now, and he just sounds amazing from what little I've heard. And I'm still stuck here. It's the first week after I came close to killing myself a couple times, and I know I need to eat, exercise and get back to my job. But it all feels so pointless. Because my mind saw her as everything, as the light in the tunnel. But it was always gonna end up this way. And I can't imagine wanting to spend time with any other person, even my family were second to her. Opening up to them now has been freeing but it's now at a point I have to get on, try to take the pain of her having someone new and let it pass, get used to not being her everyday friend. And push towards something that's not going to include her and not despair over it.

I keep looking for the least painful way to die but it seems every way is terrifying and incredibly traumatic at best if you survive and possibly crippling and losing your bodily independence at worst. 

I can't see myself as enjoying life as I never have by myself. She was the only thing that gave me comfort and joy at the world through her. And Im having to accept she won't always be there. Not does she wish to cling onto me. ",lonely

1hz7b3y,No one tells you how lonely it is after surviving an attempt,SuicideWatch,1736633459.0,13,24,"Sorry if this is kind of unorganised or messy. I‚Äôm (14f) looking back at my timetable as I type this since everything is already blurry. That morning felt like weeks ago already though it‚Äôs been under two days. Also I‚Äôm really sorry if I refer to anything as ‚Äútoday‚Äù even though it was yesterday. I‚Äôm too out of it to proof read it and even if I did I can barely focus on reading words.

I woke up in time for school on Friday, collected everything I hoarded to take, wrote a short note, went to a co-op to buy two bottles of water, took a bus to a shopping centre near my school, went to the toilet there and took about half of everything, went to the bus stop and made my way back to school, was only about 10 minutes late, walked into science, and did a normal practical with everything kind of still fresh on my mind. I didn‚Äôt really talk to my friends much.

I had English after, everything was kind of normal but I felt a tad out of it.

Break was when I took the second half in the library. I don‚Äôt think I can say what I took on here but it made me really tired. I left early after so I could stand outside the IT room where everything was REALLY starting to hit. I struggled to type coherently and did basically nothing of work. I went to ask to go to the toilet because I felt like I was gonna be sick, but my teacher said to go to medical. I said okay but took a lap around the school looking for an open toilet, threw up then went back upstairs. I felt really bad though because I was falling asleep (unintentionally- I got more than enough sleep the previous night and I‚Äôm hardly sleeping during the day) but my friend kept talking to me and I kind of snapped at her. I felt really dizzy after 

After I had Spanish which was kind of like a free lesson since I did my Spanish speaking exam the day before and I would be sitting on the Chromebook and be doing language gym all lesson, but I fell asleep again. It wasn‚Äôt a deep sleep. The moment someone said my name or referred to me or spoke near me I‚Äôd jostle out of it then go back to sleep. Someone in my class kind of said it in front of the entire class. ‚Äú[Lee]‚Äôs fallen asleep!‚Äù I really wanted to cry after that.

I then had lunch but the library was closed to anyone who isn‚Äôt year 11 (because it was a Friday afternoon) so I had to wander around the school. I considered talking to my science teacher about what I did yesterday morning but he wasn‚Äôt in there so I waited for him to go in and checked the other classrooms and he wasn‚Äôt there either so I stood by a radiator before getting sent back downstairs (we‚Äôre not allowed upstairs during breaks and lunches). 

I had base (form/tutor/intervention, whatever you call it really) and my form tutor could tell I was ill, she just didn‚Äôt know why. I was still dizzy as fuck and struggled to stand properly and wearing my school shirt, jumper and blazer made me feel really ill.

Then I had maths (normally a hurrah, I really enjoy it most of the time, though not the homework that comes with it). I did about two questions of the starter, got the date wrong, didn‚Äôt use a ruler to split my page, got told to do the challenge box, did that, then I felt really tired again. I kept falling asleep and getting woken up. I did do a couple practice questions but mostly either got them wrong or copied off of people around me. I then just kind of fell asleep.

After class, I was gonna throw up so I looked for an open toilet. I couldn‚Äôt find one so I asked a teacher to open one. He did and I threw up like coffee grounds which I should‚Äôve taken a photo of to post to r/medical (though I posted a different picture on there so that‚Äôs fine). 

I came back home after falling asleep on the bus about 30 times. My mum was pissed asf when I got home because she went through my room for the second or third time this week and it‚Äôs too messy for her. I didn‚Äôt know exactly what was wrong but I didn‚Äôt really care. She told me to get dressed then come talk to her about my room but I fell asleep.

I woke up at 3 then threw up once or twice, I really can‚Äôt remember.

I spoke to my friend about everything and he told me (very sympathetically actually, which kind of lessened the sting) that we should stop talking because of everything with justified reasons and all which was lovely. I replied to his text then blocked him immediately.

My mum gave me a lecture about all the spoilt food she found in my room (contained in a bag). I hadn‚Äôt eaten in days before these past couple. I was kind of shocked that her first instinct was to yell at me over it than ask me if I‚Äôve actually eaten much these last few days.

I‚Äôm feeling better now but still very out of it.

But that got me thinking that failing suicide is very lonely.

Either nobody knows or the people that do know leave.

I haven‚Äôt responded to about four of my friends‚Äôs messages today because I‚Äôve felt too tired or too confused to reply.

I‚Äôve snapped at one friend today.

I‚Äôve missed rehearsals (and two friends) the day before.

It feels like all the more reason to do it again until I succeed.

But I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll fail and feel even lonelier.

I can‚Äôt really talk to anyone about this.

But yeah, I guess that‚Äôs it. My day was very normal. Too normal. Nothing apart from illness and losing friends came out of it. And I‚Äôm sadder than before. I don‚Äôt know. ",lonely

I'll likely not be responding a lot as it's taking a lot out of me just to start writing this, but I'll probably be reading most comments. 

A month before my 20th birthday my dad got scammed out of a lot of money on a dating website, it made him extremely pissed off and he attacked me with a knife on his way to get a shotgun. I managed to wrestle him to the ground and get the knife off of him without being stabbed, but I wasn't able to keep him from moving closer to grab the knife again. I ended up using the hose of a tire pump nearby to choke him, but in my panic I didn't think to unwrap it after he was unconscious. I ran away and called the cops and my brother.

  
I stayed outside when the cops got there and I threw up all over the porch when they told me he was dead. I spent the entire night (9-11 hours) in my pajama pants inside the holding area of the police station. When they released me the next morning I no longer had any keys to my house, my phone, any car, nor did my family want to talk to me or help me at all. I ended up having a neighbor help me open up one of the unlocked windows so I could climb in my room and grab a bag of clothes and my laptop which the cops left behind. I have no job, no money, and now I only have my laptop and a duffel bag filled with clothes. My family hates me and the only reason I'm not on the streats is because a good friend took me in. My sister even got a restraining order on me less than 2 days after it all happened. 

  
Without any way to support myself, and the constant nightmares and hillucinations of my dad, I can just barely get the energy to get out of bed. And relying exclusively on my friend for feeding and housing me just makes me feel even more guilty.

  
I just can't see a path forward and I'm hoping that maybe someone here will give me a bit of inspiration or hope that things will get better.

I never went to therapy before I often hear to avoid taking medications because it has side effects. I want to add I got bullied by boys abt appearance at 16 but i dont think other ppl got what i have. I also want to add when I see guys flirting with my mom or friends I get sudden uncontrollable anger it scares me, i think it might be ptsd. Please help

at 6 i was raped by my brother and that already affected me, the group knew how much it hurt me, but they did it anyway.
that group was the first group i came out to as gay, and there was one other girl (13)
the guys (17,15,13,13,12) used her against me.
that girl was my childhood best friend, i related to her more than anyone else.
i cant sleep at night because i can feel their ""fluids"" on my face, on my body, in my hair, in my mouth, in my eyes,
i can taste it.
im horrified.
i feel so disgusting and all i feel is it dripping off my skin,
i hate how fast my heart beats.
everynight i have flashbacks and non stop panic attacks.
i haven't told anyone, not even my parents. they only know ""something"" happened but they didnt believe me, and they said even if it did happen it was my own fault.
one of the guys keeps texting me and everytime i block him he makes a new account. he triggers me so badly.
im so tired and just want to die.
it hurts so bad and theres so many other things taht make me want to just leave.
i was severely bullied through the ages of 4-13, and never had any friends. this group was the VERY first to group to EVER like me. ive now moved schools and its actually a lot better, but the effects of literally everyone hating me still linger. i still remember vividly when a guy stomped on my foot so hard it broke, or getting slush slammed into my face, or getting shoved down stone stairs, or getting dragged by the hair. i remember hearing what people would say about me, and now thats all i can think about. what people might be thinking about me, or what they want to do to me. im sick of feeling everyones eyes on me. im sick of always feeling judged. it feels like everyone around me can see the handprints of the group still on my body. i just want to sleep, i want to sleep so so bad. ive been awake for 40 hours and i doubt ill manage to get sleep tonight. im so tired.

1i66dze,I want to die because I don't want to work ,SuicideWatch,1737420959.0,109,691,"I'm glad that I had a relatively good childhood, normally being a child means that you get to see the good part of the world, you are innocent, you are protected, people care about you, you don't have to work.

But no one warns you about growing up, you suddenly are supposed to adapt and smile at how things work in the world, you have to accept that you are going to be a slave and if you don't do it you are mentally ill, homeless or you are going to prison. I believe that people who love their jobs or their dream has always been to work as X job are brainwashed people. Jobs nowadays demand too much hours of labor and pay the bare minimum to survive/not even that, so isn't that slavery? 

I'm a young adult not processing the fact that I'm spending the little time in earth that I have working like a slave while rich people have perfect lives due to being born rich, nepotism or luck. 

I know I will get burnout but why are not people burnout enough to actually go against this system? Humans are not meant to work so much, there are people that are not working, why can't hours be shared with this people so that we all worked less? And you'll tell me something like well companies can't pay so many workers but if those workers (that previously weren't working nor making money) had money then they could buy more from these companies and so on, idk, maybe this is stupid thinking, idk anything about economy.

As I was saying I do not believe that humans are meant for this nor work the same job for 50 years, I cannot believe that this is the only system that works, I know that there must be another one. My dream is that in the future people look back and see this era as hell bc everything will have progressed so much that they can't fanthom living our horrible lives.

I was looking for other ways to make money but in this generation it looks like you have to make a clown out of yourself on social media or be super talented which I'm not compared to the incredible people that has filled all the niches, there aren't any gaps left for me.

Therefore, I will have to die. I don't want to stain my good childhood and teenage years with slavery. Life has been good, it only goes downhill from here. I tried to talk about this with other people but they are too far gone into the system, they have been brainwashed and truly believe they will be happy in this system. I feel like I'm going crazy. In order to inmortalize my life as a good one and prevent suffering I will have to do it soon as I'm in my last year of university.

1c4ekm2,workaholic parents + Suicidal Burnout,SuicideWatch,1713159539.0,0,2,"Does anyone else suffer from a dysfunctional family that centers around money, working alot and forced toxic positivey about doing stuff everyday to ""improve your life""?

He doesn't understand my autism and had made no attempts to see the struggles it causes. Especially for burnout and exacerbating ocd flares

I know on the surface it's a good thing but in practice it becomes draining and depressing. My Dad used to drink and smoke alot but now never does drinking nor smoking. He may have the casual beer after a hard day of work but it's only one.

Now he spends his free time watching ""self improvement"" videos with people like Jocko Willinks and Tony Robbins and James Clear (Atomic Habits). Holding what they say is true due to hearing it from other successful people who made alot of money. He Believes in self discipline and ""happiness is in the mind"" type mindsets. He told me today to ""get out of my comfort zone"" and push yourself because ""I'm not even trying"".

For a while I did so too. I pushed myself alot trying to get a degree in computer science and then working full time in retail during summer breaks. But the anger and mental torment I got from pushing myself wore me down. Plus I had a streak of bad luck with prof teachers and was constantly stressed about passing 24/7. Ontop of that I had lazy roommates who were passive aggressive and touched my stuff while I was gone. I knew I should have said something bug I felt like there would be tension and I had enough of it.

Chronically anxious made me depress and it caused me severe burnout. I felt drained and dragging my feet trying to finish classes. I was mad and pissed off at the unfair circumstances I was in.

The work I did at the moment made no impact because now I have moved back in with my Dad who is a severe workaholic and is Disappointed by my lack of effort to even get out of bed at a reasonable time. I wake up so sad and I feel like he never understands why I'm so pessimistic.

I live in Canada where the economy is in shambles and buying a house seems like a ""pie I the sky"" sort of deal. I want to have goals but the OCD and depression make each day a drain as I wake up and do stuff then immediately feel like sleeping again.

I have a psychiatrist but they don't understand ocd and just hope the pills will work. I'm on 100 mg of zoloft, 50mg of regular seroquel in the day, 100mg of seroquel xr at night and 1mg of klonopin daily.

I try to help my Dad but then he always ""moves the goal post"" and gives criticism to my flaws then acknowledging all the work I do for him. Like yesterday I helped him out in the yard for 4 hours. But today I had to do homework so he complains I didn't help him at all today and ignores yesterday. Never grateful for what I do to help him.

He yells alot and ""tells me to fuck off"" which he says he doesn't mean it after. But it hurts when he yells and keeps going off. I even don't like bringing stuff up as he goes on and on about stuff. Good or bad. He just talks my ear off. If I don't do what he says and give him reasons he sees them as excuse and yells at me. Even him saying he's ""talking nicely"" is condensing and is out to judge me and make me feel guilty.

Just tonight I asked if I could quickly brush my teeth and he told me to ""fuck off"" because I was using up his time. He has only an hour of free time before going to bed and can't waste five minutes to let me brush my teeth as I get too tires after watching the show. So he yells and makes me feel bad. He doesn't even stay up the whole time we were watching the show so that's annoying.

I try to love him but his working attitude is insane. He goes to bed at 12am and wakes uo around 4am to either go to work which is an hour drive there and an hour drive back. Or he's doing paperwork. He complains that he hates it but ""life is 80 percent bullshit and 20 percent fun"". Which makes me even more pessimistic. I feel tired just listening to him about it. Even other topics as he goes on and on talking. Just doesn't know when to shut up.

My mom is not better. If I miss a day of my retail job due to ocd flare she tells me to ""suck it up and go to work"". She's a whole new can of worms but both have done their part to ruin my development.

Anyways that's my rant. Does anyone have similar parents? What have you done in terms of burnout and ocd? I take supplements Like Ashwagandha, L-theanine, gaba, magnesium bisglycinate, and 5-http.

I have read a bit of atomic habits and the daily stoic 366 meditations by Ryan Holiday. Please any advice would be helpful. Thanks and have a good day

my whole life i've failed at everything. i failed school. damn near every social interaction (i'm autistic). every relationship, which i've had 4 of. i'm still with my boyfriend, he's also trans & autistic. i only date other trans&autistic people, because cis allistics would never understand the pain of being trans and autistic in this generation.

everyone sees each other as disposable. my boyfriend loves me a lot, but his depression is messing him up a lot. he struggles a lot with communication, showing up, etc. but my love for him is unconditional. not transactional like everyone else seems to view relationships. i could never hate him for all that. i would never say this to his face, but the lack of attention (bc of his depression) was a factor in what i'm doing right now.

i took pregabalin, dihydrocodeine, klonopin, and alcohol. i hope this works. if not, then i've yet again, failed. that's all i am anyway. a failure.

my mom never loved me. she was emotionally absent for my entire life. it sucks. i've been failed by and abandoned by everyone in my entire (real) life. i mean. ive been abandoned by my own mother. my own *mother*, how hilarious is that.

i can't blame my boyfriend for anything. after all, i was just like him before i got on HRT. constantly airing people, not showing up anywhere. being extremely depressed. recently he said he likely wouldn't change how he his once he gets on HRT. i don't think that's true. he just doesn't have any hope. i have hope for him, but not for me.

It was the possibly the worst thing I've ever done to myself and it's made me want to kill myself.

I think about doing it in that exact way every time but I can't bring myself to do it because of my family and girlfriend. Or maybe I'm just a pussy.

I tell my girlfriend I'm trying to stop and it feels like I'm cheating on her every time I finish watching it. Before I start watching it, I think how one time won't hurt and then afterwards I wonder why the fuck I thought that. My fetishes have devolved into some disgusting shit can't type let alone talk about. I'm not to the point where I'm watching anything illegal to fill the void. I've seen some illegal shit and I still find it gross which I think is good. I can't bring myself to tell anyone in person except close friends but not to the extent where I tell them it's hard to sleep at night sometimes because my guilt eats at me. I'm still in HS so maybe I'm stupid and overreacting and it's not that big of a deal, but it feels like it. My girlfriend says I'm the best boyfriend ever and she could never find better and it hurts every time because she doesn't deserve a man who has these problems.

It has negatively affected how I see myself and how I can perform, which has led me to constantly worry and work on improving my physique. In a way I guess that's a benefit.

1grayy3,My Pornography Addiction Has Ruined My Life,SuicideWatch,1731607386.0,25,88,"I‚Äôve been a porn addict since I was 11

Hello everyone. I‚Äôm writing this because I feel on the edge of ending it all. I feel like my life is so fucked. I‚Äôm 25 going on 26 years old, I‚Äôm financially struggling, I still live with my parents, all of my friends are progressing in life while I feel in a rut, I‚Äôve never had a real relationship, I feel great difficulty in making new friends because I‚Äôm a bum essentially, I have no money to get therapy, and I have a stutter that has remained since childhood which greatly limits my occupational options. I have no doubt my parents wonder where they went wrong, but I know the exact reasons where I did: pornography. I‚Äôve been a porn addict since I was 11 years old. I was introduced to it by a friend, and me being a curious preteen, decided to view it one night before my seventh grade year. What was the greatest short term pleasure to my 11 year old mind resulted in years of apathy and laziness. It also helped me cope with the intense bullying I received as a kid due to my aforementioned speech impediment. Everyday since those days I would come home and pleasure myself and this culminated in me wasting my life and missing important teenage and young adult milestones. It totally killed my motivation to succeed and push myself and this snowballed into other problems such as not trying hard in school, chasing fast dopamine highs and having underdeveloped social skills. Sometimes I wondered if I have autism, but I don‚Äôt want to self diagnose myself and chalk it up to poor socialization due to my speech impediment. I‚Äôve became an increasingly closed off person and not even my family knows me that well. They‚Äô wonder why I don‚Äôt come to them for my problems, but I know they‚Äôre just the understanding type so I keep things to myself. 

Plus porn addiction is not taken serious at all by society. A man admitting that would get ridiculed mercilessly, I‚Äôve seen it. It‚Äôs such a hard addiction to beat. Not saying that this easy at all, but at least with drugs, you can physically remove yourself from the substances that are causing your habits and you have to go through many steps to acquire said substances like going to meet a dealer. Porn and masturbation addiction is available 24/7. Unless I cut off my dick, I‚Äôll always have the option to masturbate. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I don‚Äôt even need porn to get off anymore. I can‚Äôt just masturbate off memories of porn scenes and past sexual experiences. I‚Äôve seriously considered breaking my own hand just to curtail the problem. I just can‚Äôt stop.

Im going to preface this with that I take full responsibility for my situation. I‚Äôm just so frustrated that whenever I make a change, I always end up right back to where I started or even worse. I‚Äôm so ashamed of myself that it‚Äôs painful to even write this. Suicide has been growing increasingly appealing to me lately. The only thing that stops me is the financial burden that would beset my family should I go through with it and the anguish it would cause them. I just wish I could run away and start over.",addiction

So I form a plan which pushes my limits but not far enough so I don‚Äôt have any control over it. I then attempt suicide once again. 

The whole procedure makes me thrilled in some strange way. In a way, I enjoy making my family worried and getting 911 called on me. In a way I enjoy getting sent to the hospital to check and then to the psych ward. But it feels wrong to say I enjoy it fully because I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt like scaring my family and getting locked into a psych ward, not really. Maybe it‚Äôs just a sick part of my brain that likes it. Or. It gives me a boost. When attempting, I break my pattern, that pattern I hate with my whole heart.

I feel as if suicide is the only way. That suicide is how my life is set to end. So in a strange way I always strive for it and if my therapist congratulates me for keeping the thoughts as thoughts they become a threat to me. It‚Äôs me and my depression against them. That‚Äôs how I feel.

I'm going to end it all very soon so I dont mind saying my reasoning.

I hope reincarnation is real

When I tried it last time, there was buzzing that wouldn't leave me, but I tried pushing past that point.

If I haven't, then I've also won, this is the end; even if I was wrong, I will still be ""alive', my body will be returned to the earth and the nutrients my ashes or body provides will supplement new life. In essence, I never really died.

You can think of the grass near my grave as me. I don't wish for a funeral but atleast give place my ashes beneath the soil. I don't want to be lying in an irn jn your living room. 

I love my family but spent too much time in my life being lazy, I read too many fantasy novels, and later on I dreamed too many dreams that couldn't exist within this realm.

My belief is that this isnt the end. My belief, is that once I pass out, I will be reborn and underworld and I will suffer for my sins, after suffering and serving my sentence, I will be given the choice to either drink meng Po's soup, or erase my memories. I will drink the soup and live the life that samsara has granted me

ovdnkd,I am 14 years old and believe I have developed a cocaine addiction and fucked everything up. Suicidal,SuicideWatch,1627760677.0,8,9,"
Let me preface by saying that I‚Äôm only 14, turning 15 in august. let‚Äôs just say the people I grew up around fucked me up and so did (do) my current friends. The city that I live in, in the third world country known as the United States really doesn‚Äôt help either (cheap drugs, poverty, extremely depressing overall, a lot of people start using at my age) But really only have myself to blame

When I was 11, I was introduced to weed by my brother. I loved it and became a daily smoker at that age. Not long after, I was introduced to shrooms.

Again, loved it and a year later, at age 12 I tried acid for the first time. I fell in love with psychedelics and took acid/shrooms almost monthly for a while. 
Took a break from psychedelics and weed after it caused hefty derealization.

Only a week ago, my ex girlfriend (15) who has recently become a massive coke addict, invited me over to do coke with her. I was hesitant about it but I wanted to see what it‚Äôs like. We binged about .5 that night, no euphoria, barely even more intense than a couple cups of coffee, loved the drip however. 

Extremely boring and pointless feeling, but every 10 minutes all I wanted was another line. Ended up having unprotected sex as I had zero inhibition which risks aside, made me feel like a total piece of shit as I‚Äôm currently in a very happy relationship with my girlfriend (16) and have been for 9 months.

When the comedown hit, I felt an overwhelming wave of shame, along with wanting more coke. Lied to her and told her I missed a dose of my meds and went home because i was so ashamed of myself

I spent the entirety of the next day sucking the coke residue off the post it notes that we used to snort it with. Promised myself I‚Äôd never do it again and felt like a total piece of shit, was kind of using the leftover coke to combat the shame I was feeling. Also freaked the fuck out about pregnancy and bought an ec pill for her, which she refused to take. 

I forgot about coke until yesterday when she texted me asking to come do more coke. I was reminded of what I felt on it (albeit barely anything at all) and accepted. 

Gave her $50 for coke, which was all the money I had, which I was saving for a new guitar pedal. Guess what? Same exact thing happened. The exact same thing I promised I‚Äôd never do again. We did about half the bag and again realized what I had done.

I went home which she literally begged me not to do, but I just couldn‚Äôt fucking stay there, it was less about the coke but more about the fact that I was with her, someone who I promised myself I would cut out of my life and once again cheated on my fucking girlfriend. It‚Äôs currently 4am and I‚Äôve spent the whole night sucking on the post it notes and snorting random white specks off my clothes. 

I left the bag at her house and she‚Äôs asking me to hang out tomorrow to finish off the bag and I really don‚Äôt know if I have the willpower to decline it. 

These are the only two times I‚Äôve done coke, I had no idea how horrible this drug is. Is my life already ruined? These are the only two times I‚Äôve done this, but am I already captured? Did I fuck everything up?

What the fuck do I do? As I‚Äôm writing this I am having a full blown panic attack, can‚Äôt stop thinking about how I cheated on my girlfriend, wanting more coke, worrying that I got her pregnant and wondering if I‚Äôm already fucked. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm full on addicted yet, so there may still be time. I am a pretty promising musician, released a couple albums that people like and get decent grades. I literally don‚Äôt know how I can carry on, what am I going to do?

I posted this to a sub for quitting coke but I was shamed and mocked.

I really don‚Äôt care if you judge me, I know that I‚Äôm a piece of shit.",cocaine

I mean, what would you expect someone with PTSD to do after returning from deployment? Doing cocaine once and confessing to it sounds like someone that needs help, not someone that needs to be kicked out and completely forgotten about. 

That doesn‚Äôt matter anymore, I made a promise with myself, I was going to kill myself if I was turned down by the VA for my disability application, and that‚Äôs exactly what happened. 

I won‚Äôt kill myself today or even this week. I need to pay next months rent and pack all of my stuff into separate bags and label who it will belong to, but I‚Äôve already hung a noose made out of para cord from my second floor and cut out some memory foam to wrap around my neck so it‚Äôs not painful.

I was molested as a child, my dad used to beat my mom and cheat on her, he used to beat me too. My older sister and brothers also used to beat me. And then I was homeless at 17 after my big brother beat me up at my highschool and bounced from shelter to shelter until I was 18 and then I slept in the streets for a bit until I met my ex boyfriend who took me in. I had a 6 year relationship that ended up being violent physically and financially. I got raped 3 times, the first time was right after my first break up. he put something in my drink and left me at his friends house when he was done with me. His friend found me in his appartment unconscious and did his thing too. I got pregnant from it and didn't know i was pregnant- i was drinking lots of alcohol because i was depressed I lost the baby. I only found out I was pregnant when I went to the hospital from the worst belly pain in my life and they told me it was a miscarriage. My second rape was from a friend I had known for 3 years, I knew his girlfriend and everything. Still not 1000% sure he put something in my drink but all I remember from the night was meeting him for drinks - I remember nothing after drinking my first drink except that he kept pushing me to drink my second drink, he kept saying ""bottoms up you have to finish the drink"" -  he kicked me out his room at 4in the morning and the hotel staff helped me get in an Uber. 3 rape was from an old boss, he gave me coke and a bunch of drugs and pressured me until I said yes, I was scared and I just wanted to get it over with so after saying no a million times I said yes. He knew I was raped just two months before cause I told him that's the reason why I didn't want to have sex. The day after he started being extremely mean at work but I couldn't quit cause I was poor and practically homeless. 

i got betrayed by every single friend I've ever had one way or another - friends have stolen money from me, or just been really unsupportive and leeching off whatever small amounts of money I'd have.

At work, I get sexually harassed at almost every single job I've ever had, I'm fairly attractive and men only see me for what they can get from me. 

Mostly, I'm exhausted of constantly needing to work to provide for myself. I have no one to help me and it's becoming really hard to work as I get more and more depressed.

I don't speak to my family except my mom and baby brother. They're they only ones I don't want to hurt and I'm sorry for what I'm about to do to them.

There's a chance I get a new job this week after being unemployed for two months. I have 35$ left in my bank account

If I get the job I'll stay, if not, I'll swallow a couple boxes of Xanax and use the last of my money to buy alcohol to make the Xanax work faster

16pf2jy,(Advice) Girlfriend overdosed on purpose,SuicideWatch,1695400954.0,82,220,"Edit: Thank you everyone. I just got to see her and she seems much better from the other day. She's stable and rational she understands she has made a bad decision, and it has consequences, but she realizes how much help she needs. She also realizes how many people love her and care for her. They are currently saying to expect a week's stay. If she's still here next weekend, I'll be staying up there all weekend so I can see her each day. She's 3 hours away, so I can't visit every day, but I will be calling every day. The facility seems very nice she said it's much better than the others she's been to. We're very hopeful. 



I'm sorry if this isn't the place for this and for how long it is but i just dont know what to do.  I'm currently trying to see a therapist and my family is supportive they just have no real experience with anything like this. I feel lost and helpless right now and really just don't know what to do and this seems like a place for support. I'm really just looking for some advice from people who might understand. My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half. She has always struggled with depression and anxiety but it has never been as bad as it has been the past month or two. She tried to kill herself once before we met and I was aware of this early on in the relationship. Her work has been extremely stressful lately, she has been having family issues with her parents and some with her sister, and her insurance was canceled last month. She hasn't been able to go to therapy and she's been stressed about the increase in her med costs. She also found out that I had been talking to other girls early on when we had first started dating, I had stopped when we got serious and I realized I wanted to build a life with her, nothing physical happened but she was still extremely upset (understandably so) she said she forgave me but I suspect it still a sore spot. I gave her access to my phone and my social accounts to try to alleviate any worries. But I feel like all of this was just too much for her, she's been missing work for over 2 weeks now fortunately her boss was/is a very kind man and told her her only job right now is to get better. I've been trying to take care of bills to help allievate some stress too since she can't afford her half right now. There has been alot of very long nights with her the past couple of weeks where she can't stop crying or having panic attacks and I've stayed up with her. I just started a new job and am on probation or else I would be putting in sick time. But we currently can't afford me missing any work. She gave me her Xanax because she didn't trust her self and I'd been giving her 2 a day just in case and been keeping the bottle locked up or with me. She was checking in with me every hour while I was at work, my mom would sit with her some days since she doesn't work. She really seemed like she was getting better, she had interviews for new jobs to try to get one with health insurance. Crying nights and panic attacks weren't happening. She was in a better mood doing her hobbies. But Wednesday she didn't check in the last hour of my shift, I tried calling she wasn't answering, I kept calling still nothing. I was hoping she just fell asleep. I got home and found her in bed and assumed she was just asleep. I went in the kitchen and found 5 empty pill bottles. I immediately ran in and tried to wake her up but she was unresponsive. I thought she wasn't breathing at first but it was just super shallow. I called 911 and texted both our moms. The dispatcher had me perform CPR and after a round of that her breathing normalized. EMS arrived pretty quickly thank God and stabilized her and took her away. My mom took me to the ER cause I was shaking so bad I couldn't drive. Her parents arrived shortly after and we got to visit her after an hour, she was still super out of it until about 11pm. She wouldn't talk about why she did it she just kept saying how much she loved all of us, and how tired she was. I had work the next day so her mom told me to go home and get some rest and she stayed the night. She was involuntarily committed the next day, but all the mental hospitals here are currently full and she's on hold at the hospital until something opens up. If nothing opens up in the next couple of days they said she might be released. Noone is allowed to see her and they're only letting her mom call her once a day for a few minutes currently. I really don't know what to do or even if I can do anything right now. I feel so helpless and alone. Our house feels so empty with out her. I keep just breaking down and crying. My coworkers have been great they told me just do what I can and they've been helping me with everything else, If I break down at work they give me however long I need and my boss said if anything changes I can leave whenever. My family is supportive to a fault almost smootheringly so. I'm just so tired and I don't know what to do to make things ok for her. I cleaned the house so it's stress free whenever she comes home. I want to decorate it for Halloween because it's her favorite holiday, but we were supposed to do it together and I don't want her to be upset she missed it. I'm taking care of her guinea pig best I can. I just don't want her to hate me for her being admitted but she needs help. 
I'm trying to make sure her mom is OK too. But I've never been in this situation before. I have depression my self and have been suicidal, but I've never been to a mental health hospital. She's told me horror stories of how bad it was and even the mention of it spirals her into a panic attack. I'm sorry this is rambling but is just need some advice.

1jcd853,I have been stealing money from and lying to my parents about med school for years and I'm going to end my life for it,SuicideWatch,1742097795.0,18,51,"Basically the title. I have been telling my parents that I was studying in medical school for the last 4 years and my parents generously paid my rent and tuition for the first two years of school. After the first two years, I then went on a leave of absence due to severe depression, but I didn't tell my parents about it. We're Asian, so I knew they wouldn't approve since they really don't believe in mental health stuff, and I really told myself I would use the time to get my mind right, study a bit and work on and improve myself. 

Well, the furthest thing from that ended up happening these last two years. I just ended up working part time just to cover rent and some basic living expenses, but I did nothing to cure my depression, didn't study at all, and got nothing done in life. I have basically been working for a few hours a day and wasting away in bed, and have nothing to show for the last two years. However, that didn't stop me from accepting my parents' money. While I did cover rent and food, my mom still made me microwaveable meals from time to time, bought me clothes and shoes and sent me some money every now and then. They thought all of this was an investment into my future, but really I was just squandering it away and being a lazy bum. I know I'm a horrible person for taking their love and support and money and doing nothing with it. I know I had so much privilege and threw it all away. I'm a fuckup who deserves absolutely no sympathy. But even knowing all this, I'm still a coward and I still haven't told them about any of this. Instead I've been weaving and telling them thousands of lies about what kinds of patients I've seen, the friends I've been talking to, the things I've learned, etc. As more time passed, I got deeper in the lie, so I kept telling more since I just didn't want to deal with the shitstorm that comes with the truth. I avoided my issues, telling myself that I would fix things eventually. 

Well, my ""graduation"" is coming up soon - my parents are so happy because they think I'm finally going to be a doctor soon. I can't lie my way out of this one. There's nowhere to go or run, so the truth is coming out. I can't bear to look them in the eye and reveal to them how badly I fucked up my life. I can't imagine how they'll feel when they realize the precious son they've been so proud of has been a pathological liar the past few years. They'll never see me the same again. Plus, my school is expecting me back in a few days, but I'm absolutely not ready at all, and I'm not allowed to ask for more time off. Not that it would be a good idea - clearly I've bungled the last two years, what good would another do? I'm looking at a lifetime with no career prospects, no good direction in life and no sense of purpose. So I'm finally going to do the right thing and rid the world of the disgusting piece of trash that I am. I plan on overdosing on some pills I have and hopefully dying in my sleep. Perhaps it will just be recorded as a sudden death, and I can preserve some dignity for myself. Either way, this nightmare of mine will be over. I'm sick and tired of lying to my parents' face. They didn't deserve this, and I don't deserve to live or have anything good in life. I'm really scared to die but I don't have a choice. ",end my life

I've had two ""intimate"" experiences in my life and they both left me with trauma. My first experience was at 16 and my last experience was when I was 22.

The first one was during the only relationship I ever had. We were both 16 and she really wanted us to share our first time together, but she lost interest in me when she saw me naked. She then cheated on me and told all her friends about me, before dumping me.

It took me a long time to get over that and at 22 I went on a date with a woman in her late 30s. The date went really well and she invited me back to hers, but when she saw my penis she said ""that's a little..um..small..."" at which point I froze for a minute and then left

I haven't tried to meet anyone after that and I'm terrified at the prospect of dating & I have a phobia of intimacy that I'll likely never get over. I can't face being humiliated again.  On social media it's ""small dick energy"" this and ""big dick energy"" that.. I'm constantly reminded that I'm a low value person because of my body and I can't live this way.

1dfd9ve,I‚Äôm going to kill myself after I give birth,SuicideWatch,1718322537.0,248,620,"I (20F) have been with my boyfriend (21M) for 2.5 years, and he has made it clear he wants kids from the beginning. I‚Äôm diagnosed with autism and was always pretty firm on not wanting kids, but he made me feel like we would be able to handle it together if we had kids, so slowly over time I came around to the idea.

A year and a half ago, I got pregnant but we were in a bad financial position, so I had an abortion early on. It was a mutual agreement, and I moved past it pretty easily, but he was really torn up about it. I told him when we‚Äôre able to bring a kid into the world, we would go through with it.

Since then I‚Äôm making a lot more money and he also has a job now. Back in January of this year, I found out I‚Äôm pregnant, and expected to deliver at the end of August. He was very excited and told me he wanted me to keep it, and although for the longest time I didn‚Äôt want kids, I genuinely saw a future with this man and thought having a kid together was a beautiful thing.

Sometime in the last two months, he has gone from being excited about the baby‚Äî sharing ultrasound pictures, wanting to make sure I‚Äôm drinking enough water and eating enough for me and the baby‚Äî to not wanting this kid at all. He told me he realized he‚Äôs not ready for kids, and he‚Äôs not willing to ‚Äúthrow his whole life away‚Äù for one kid. He realized he doesn‚Äôt want to give up his own personal freedom and playing video games all day/not having any major responsibilities. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, those are all reasons I didn‚Äôt want to have kids in the first place and I communicated that to him, but back in January, he talked me into changing my mind because I thought ‚ÄúI love this man, we can actually support this child now, and my love is so strong that I want to start a family‚Äù.

Now he‚Äôs giving me my options. We‚Äôre saving up for our own place, and my parents have money, so they let us stay at their house and we have our own bedroom and living room. They are EXTREMELY excited and supportive about a grandchild. I‚Äôm so grateful for them. But my bf says either he‚Äôs leaving once the baby is here and I have to be a single mom, we have to give the baby up for adoption and get kicked out by my parents, or to stage an accident to cause a late miscarriage and say it was a mistake. I‚Äôm pro choice but I‚Äôm 28 weeks pregnant, and he(the baby) moves around a lot, this is a real baby, nothing like the abortion I had at 6 weeks. I‚Äôm not a monster.

But I only changed my mind about kids because I thought we were going to do this together, he wanted it so bad. Now he‚Äôs completely flipped and talks about how unwanted this baby is for him and how he should have never convinced me to keep the pregnancy. I thought maybe he was just scared and he wasn‚Äôt good at showing it, but he‚Äôs made it clear he wants nothing to do with raising a child. Without a partner to co parent with, I would have never wanted this kid. I don‚Äôt want this kid to grow up with a regretful single mom or a dad who doesn‚Äôt want him.

My boyfriend says he loves me and wants nothing bad to happen to me, but I can‚Äôt raise a kid by myself. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm high functioning enough to do it without the other parent, but everyone tells me I‚Äôll be an amazing mother. But my baby deserves so much better than me. No one is going to want to date and marry an autistic single mom who‚Äôll never be able to drive. I thought I was super lucky with my boyfriend, and now I feel so blindsided.

Once my baby is born, I‚Äôm going to kill myself. My boyfriend can find someone to move in with, he‚Äôd have to anyway if he‚Äôs going to leave once the baby is here anyway. I‚Äôm saving up money and buying lots of baby items so it isn‚Äôt as big of a financial burden to my parents. My parents are amazing people and tell me I can live at home with the baby as long as I would like, so I feel comfort knowing they‚Äôll have my baby to remember me by, and my son will have such a loving household.

I can‚Äôt tell anyone this, so I came here to get this off my chest. I‚Äôm going to cherish the last two months I have with my boyfriend and my family. I never wanted to be a single mom, and I can‚Äôt bare to think about seeing my baby every day and him looking like my boyfriend, thinking how he‚Äôs gone back on his word hurts so bad. I would‚Äôve just had another abortion and looked into better birth control if he had realized he didn‚Äôt want kids back then. We could have been a happy childfree couple. I hope when my son is older, he‚Äôll understand. ",kill myself

I've tried so hard since this all started, all I've ever wanted out of life is to be loved and cared for and be held. A lover, a partner and best friend and a few close friends is all I ever wanted out of life. Whatever situation I was in as long as I had that I'd be okay. But it's become clear that no matter what I do that's just not meant for me. 

It's all I ever do is annoy and repel and be a burden on others. In the past I've blamed the others for not wanting to be around me but it's become clear that it's me. It's always been me.

I can't keep going anymore. I can't keep up this fight anymore when it's only me that cares who wins and even saying that is a stretch. The only reason I've kept going this long is because I've held out hope that someday someway somehow someone would meet me and love me for who I am. Now I see how delusional that is. Not to mention selfish expecting anyone to suffer along being close to me like that. 

I give up. I just can't go on like this anymore. I needed someone I could fight for. Someone I could push on and get better for. But I just can't keep up the hope anymore that that someone is ever going to come not to mention the fact that I don't deserve it anyway. I'm not worthy of being loved. I'm not worthy of reaching the goals I've wanted for so long and I doubt I ever will be because I've been trying for so long and I'm still alone.

I (25M) managed to make a life for myself after the pandemic (and after having a shitty past too). I graduated university as an engineer, I had a loving girlfriend that I wished to marry, I even got a decent job in automotive industry. Mistakes were made during the relationship and at the job since both were my firsts in the real sense, and I worked hard to fix them all. Things worsened on both sides despite my efforts (I even went into therapy), and at the start of 2024 I was laid off and I broke up with my girlfriend, almost at the same time. No longer having funds cut my therapy too. I ended up ill and even spent a bit in the hospital because of a seizure. I can't afford psychiatric medication either. My family ended up in a poor spot, they can't help me with any of that, they even started to demonize me because of my mental state and how I act because of it...

One year later it's even worse. Applied to hundreds of jobs and got rejected or ignored because they only look at my limited experience and not at my skills, despite learning more stuff (even AI) and modifying my CV and cover letters constantly. Found no one else to date because no one wants anything serious anymore no matter where I look (not to mention being taken for a creep if I approach someone I like even at an event like comic con), and also it feels like I don't fit anyone's criteria, and no one fits mine either. Casual stuff or FWBs/ONSs are not helpful and would make things worse for me. It's the way I am.

No matter how hard I try and whatever I do or learn to impress, i'm not being given a second chance at life. I can't go on like this, if I don't deserve it, if I really failed my ex and my former job so bad that I don't deserve any chance to start over, then why should I keep on living? I suffered enough, really. Enough is enough at some point no matter the age or whatever strength is there. I reached my limit. I learned my lessons and I want to start over and do better, but how if I can't get even one chance to do that?

Any hobby I had is boring and I find no pleasure in anything. I also had enough of hearing the same words over and over. ""work on yourself"", ""focus on yourself"", ""care for yourself"", ""it gets better"", ""move on"". Yes yes I get it but I didn't get that degree to do nothing with my life.

1i6uhhf,"I killed my dad, and I'm not sure how I'm supposed to live anymore",SuicideWatch,1737496489.0,148,1402,"A bit of warning before anyone starts commenting on this. I'll likely not be responding a lot as it's taking a lot out of me just to start writing this, but I'll probably be reading most comments. 

A month before my 20th birthday my dad got scammed out of a lot of money on a dating website, it made him extremely pissed off and he attacked me with a knife on his way to get a shotgun. I managed to wrestle him to the ground and get the knife off of him without being stabbed, but I wasn't able to keep him from moving closer to grab the knife again. I ended up using the hose of a tire pump nearby to choke him, but in my panic I didn't think to unwrap it after he was unconscious. I ran away and called the cops and my brother.

  
I stayed outside when the cops got there and I threw up all over the porch when they told me he was dead. I spent the entire night (9-11 hours) in my pajama pants inside the holding area of the police station. When they released me the next morning I no longer had any keys to my house, my phone, any car, nor did my family want to talk to me or help me at all. I ended up having a neighbor help me open up one of the unlocked windows so I could climb in my room and grab a bag of clothes and my laptop which the cops left behind. I have no job, no money, and now I only have my laptop and a duffel bag filled with clothes. My family hates me and the only reason I'm not on the streats is because a good friend took me in. My sister even got a restraining order on me less than 2 days after it all happened. 

  
Without any way to support myself, and the constant nightmares and hillucinations of my dad, I can just barely get the energy to get out of bed. And relying exclusively on my friend for feeding and housing me just makes me feel even more guilty.

  
I just can't see a path forward and I'm hoping that maybe someone here will give me a bit of inspiration or hope that things will get better. Hell, even just finding someone with a similar experience to talk to might be nice, makes me feel fucking evil and insane that I killed my dad.",no reason to live

1jcjvc5,Recently cut myself for the first time at age 25,SuicideWatch,1742126313.0,0,2,"Tw self harm, suicidal thoughts 

Last week I skipped my therapy appointment (slept through it) because the day before I had cut myself for the first time in my life and I was too ashamed and did not want to talk about it. The thing that made me feel so unstable that I ended up doing something like that is that my emotionally abusive mom called a week ago to say that she‚Äôs coming to visit me next month even though I have explicitly told her to please never visit me. I moved to a different country 2 years ago to escape my abusive home environment and her doing this makes me feel like no matter where I am I cannot be safe. I wanted to do something, anything to prove that my body only belonged to me and not anyone else and that‚Äôs why I ended up resorting to something like that. I feel incredibly ashamed that I‚Äôm 25 and most fucking people do not start cutting themselves at 25. But I lived with my family until age 23 and never had the privacy to.
I am also in the process of trying to get an ADHD diagnosis from a psychiatrist. Had my initial appt yesterday and talking about my trauma (because I have significant PTSD symptoms which are hard to disentangle from potential ADHD) was so fucking destabilizing and distressing that after the appointment while walking over a bridge I had so many intrusive thoughts about jumping even though I absolutely don‚Äôt want to die by drowning and would never do that. I‚Äôm so fucking stressed and don‚Äôt know how to even verbalize these things to my therapist when I see her next because it feels too extreme and serious. I‚Äôm not actively suicidal, just troubled when I experience impulses that I don‚Äôt want to act on. I‚Äôve been feeling more impulsive lately and I know jumping from a bridge into a river is not something I can walk back from like cutting myself.
It‚Äôs not something you can try just to see how it feels and the consequences of trying and failing are too great (my emergency contacts would be contacted like my fucking work supervisor and my mom, who might force me to move back to the US if I attempt suicide here in Japan and fail. I don‚Äôt actually want to attempt. I just keep feeling very impulsive. Since that first time cutting exactly a week ago, I tried it two more times. All 3 times I‚Äôve only made very very shallow cuts that barely break skin or bleed and definetly won‚Äôt scar. I have a medical procedure (endoscopy) on the 31st for which I‚Äôll require an IV and I don‚Äôt have to have any obvious scars on my arm that they could see. I feel incredibly unstable. I can‚Äôt focus on anything or sit still and my thoughts are going haywire. I don‚Äôt want to talk about this to any irl friends because it‚Äôs just too fucking serious and heavy.",cutting myself

Edit: I think it needs to be here, ‚ÄòObjectively, depression and anxiety both suck, sometimes **the change** from months long depression to anxiety, and vice versa, **feels better**. Then you realize it is not energy or motivation but anxiety, it is not calmness it is numbness from depression.

1dw19hn,Nurse just told me to accept that im going to be an anxious wreck forever.,Anxiety,1720194896.0,237,521,"Ive been seeing this nurse for a couple of years now. She initially put me on sertraline, after me telling her about my social anxiety and rumination. 

Ive done it all. 15 years on and off therapy, citalopram, sertraline, hypnosis, cold water therapy, exposure therapy etc... Nothing seems to have shifted this crazy adrenaline response i get when im anxious. I live a life where im pushing myself out of my comfort zone often. Nothing seems to be working. I must say, when im not anxious im a lot more ballsy and glass half full. So the above has worked in that sense, but nothing for this strong surge of adrenaline that i get when i feel like im the center of attention. My arms and legs go numb, heart races, sweating...

But yeah, she told me that the sertraline is helping my anxiety more than i think. Even though we only catch up 1-2 times a year? and while talking to her today i was visibly shaking like a leaf. As we went through my previous notes nothing had positively changed in my life. Then she tried to convince me to stay on the drug and said how im just going to have to accept that this is who i am and live with the anxiety. So basically shes saying i should give up and carry on taking sertraline which from the start, isn't making me any less anxious.

In the end I told her im stopping the sertraline. Im going to go down a different route as i dont agree with what has been said. It pisses me off because i know for a fact there is light at the end of the tunnel. She could be saying this type of thing to so many people who dont know better. If i was a child and she told me that i was going to have to live life shaking like a leaf and not able to get any words out whenever a stranger talks to me then i would have probably gone down a bad path.

Dont know if im just batshit crazy at this point or if this Nurse is fucking clueless? 

If anyone else has had a similar experience with a mental health nurse, please dont give up. It is absolutely possible to change your brain and subconscious response to things. Yes, i get that Anxiety is a part of life which is healthy...but if it's at a level where its ruining your happiness in day-to-day life, dont let anyone convince you that you will never get past it.

Sometimes there would be days that i would be able to eat somewhat normally, but then the day after the pain and the nausea would be back. Of course, this is causing weightloss, and I didn't weigh much to begin with. This makes me even more anxious as I get scared that there's something wrong (like cancer or something).

My doctor referred me to a psychologist, but the waittimes are brutal, i'll have starved before I can get an appointment. I'm becoming desperate.

Years later I came off escitalopram to be able to use hydroxyzine on demand, because I was unable to cope with severe stressors, and I realized two things: 1, my constant, absolutely unending fatigue wasn't me, it was the meds and 2, I need meds, because I can't function without them. So I tried zoloft, again it worked at a super low dose, but I had intolerable side effects. I also have ADHD (and was diagnosed with GAD in the meantime), so I'm currently trying atomoxetine, but it's been weeks and I don't think it's doing anything for me. My psychiatrist said that SSRIs are not an option right now because of the side effects they give me. I feel like my options are disappearing and nothing can help me. I tried therapy (CBT and MCT), but it was useless, and I feel like it trivializes my anxiety. Do they really think in my 30+ years of having anxiety I wouldn't have already started ""just postponing my worry"" if I was capable of doing so? Do they actually believe I need to be told to just ""analyze my worries and see how unlikely they are to happen"", as if I'm not already constantly analyzing all of them, and am fully aware they are unlikely, but that knowledge doesn't help? Or if I just start meditating it'll all go away? I tried meditation, I tried grounding techniques, I tried mindfulness techniques, I tried listing my thoughts and naming them, I tried sleeping enough, I tried eating healthy, NONE OF IT WORKS. My psychiatrist is hoping that reducing my ADHD symptoms will reduce my anxiety, but without SSRIs, anxiety is my baseline. I have nothing to worry about, I have a stable job, a stable relationship, a loving family, a nice apartment, I have access to public healthcare and have a good insurance to access private healthcare. My life is objectively good and probably the goal for many. And yet I feel like I'm being chased by an apex predator 90% of my waking moments, and like it's all about to come crashing down, and I'm moments away from a disaster.



It just all fills me with so much anger at this point. I read an article from a psychiatrist that people with an anxiety disorder should really just try therapy first, and if that fails maybe try SSRIs. Well what about people like me then? What do they suggest I do? Should I just go die because my body is not responding the way it's supposed to? 



I feel like therapy is never going to work because I've tried it all and it did nothing for me, and the meds are failing me. So either I go back to being so exhausted I can't enjoy my life (not to mention the other side effects), or I stay off the meds and I still can't enjoy my life but with more energy and anxiety. It's all so depressing.

  
I'm sorry for the rant, but at this point I'm just so angry at the world, and at people who keep preaching about therapy, and who keep pretending anxiety isn't an actual debilitating disease, and I don't know who to talk to that would actually understand my frustration. ",hopeless

1jles5t,"My coworker causes me anxiety. I feel overwhelmed, helpless, emotional. What should I do or avoid doing?",Anxiety,1743112147.0,6,1,"I am finding it challenging to communicate and collaborate with my coworker, whom I work somewhat closely with. (I have some control over how closely, but more is encouraged by management.)

I feel extremely stressed. I take propranolol but I notice the less I work with her the less I need. During my time off I stopped reading emails and haven‚Äôt taken any in a week. 

The more I work with her and do what she wants, the happier she is and the less badly she treats me. It also helps my role to some extent. 

However we then have to have hour long daily meetings after work hours (there is not another way). I come home to my family later as a result. I am willing to do this but here‚Äôs the problem. 

- Afterwards, I receive one or more emails rephrasing the conversation, often with one or more inaccurate things which I then need to clarify. Or re-bringing up an issue we just discussed and decided on, but then she says ‚ÄúI just thought of ‚Ä¶‚Äù so it restarts the discussion, this time with a string of email exchanges with lots of follow up questions for me. 

- if I don‚Äôt go to her for the meeting, she gets mad. But she doesn‚Äôt come to me. She then emails me and is rude. 

- sometimes when I do come to her to meet as needed, she says ‚Äúyes, what do you want? Do we need to talk about something?‚Äù 

- she is very sensitive and latches on to certain things I say and misunderstands them, so it takes me a long time to formulate a reply, because I have to be extremely precise, otherwise it might be misunderstood

- often it takes me another hour to reply, or need to write emails on and off throughout an evening or weekend, taking me away from family and work. I already have a big workload which necessitates some additional work evenings and weekends. 

- therse emails make me feel anxious and stressed and I either end up pretending I‚Äôm not, or my family notices and they get upset with me that I‚Äôm letting work affect me too much. It‚Äôs to a level where often I can‚Äôt hide it. 

- I have less time for my kids as it increases my workload 

- I become more emotional and feel exhausted after dealing with her

- If I don‚Äôt reply for matters than aren‚Äôt urgent, the next day, she will be passive aggressive, condescending and rude and make my job harder (not to mention the emotional impact of someone behaving that way to you all day) 

- I told my manager I struggle with the style of communication and the emails and he‚Äôs seen some of them as she copied him. He oversimplifies when advising me saying ‚Äújust reply more briefly‚Äù which seems logical in theory but much more difficult in practice. He knwows I get therapy for this relationship but when I recently asked whether he recommends collaborating on upcoming project he said yes I should and said I shouldn‚Äôt be afraid etc. making it seem like he thinks I am avoiding this out of my insecurities. 

Her justification for the emails is that she needs ‚Äúprocessing time‚Äù and ‚Äúcan‚Äôt think of everything in the moment‚Äù and apologizes ‚Äúsorry for another email but‚Ä¶‚Äù . I‚Äôve told her this causes me stress and time away for my family. It stopped for a short time and then continued.

We are beginning to collaborate on a project and I set a time limit for two weeks. She already asked for one more day and sent at least two emails. I am on holiday and didn‚Äôt reply as they were sent at the start of my holiday. For the first time ever, I didn‚Äôt read them either, just the subject and first line. 

I‚Äôm going back to work next Monday and already feel stressed. I deleted my email app from my phone in order to have some peace during my time off. I‚Äôm now semi-afraid to re-install it and haven‚Äôt seen any other emails in order to avoid seeing hers.

Any advice and tips would be appreciated.

I‚Äôm not officially diagnosed with anything, I‚Äôve never been tested. But I‚Äôm very anxious and I think I have some form of OCD. Basically my biggest issues of a compulsive obsession with others opinions and an obsession with the idea of being a good person. After some brief research, I think I can identify with moral scrupulosity and Fear of Negative Evaluation. My most basic example I like to use is that if a music critic or a literal nobody on social media says harsh enough words about a band I like, it will take me literal weeks to months to muster up the courage to listen to them again. So as you can assume, it‚Äôs a million times worth when politics are involved. There have been days when I don‚Äôt leave my room for a full day, not to eat or see my family, because I am doomscrolling on Reddit or TikTok for literally 12 hours straight. Uninterrupted.

These are series of the questions that are keeping on spinning in my head since last 20-25 days. I really want some advice and help but can‚Äôt share it with anyone then because I‚Äôm scared of failing them too‚Ä¶

A small background about me is like this‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm an Indian man of age 32 and came to Canada last year on a study visa with a loan of 25 lakhs INR. Yes, 32 age and on study visa. After completing my highschool I wasted 4 years studying a non relevant field where I was not interested but upon taking some advice about what suits best for me, but after 4 long years I realized that it‚Äôs not for me. It was a commerce field. So, I restarted from diploma in computer science and did well there with students of 4 years lesser age than me. 

Completed my bachelors in that in 2017 and then started with a small job. Then I didn‚Äôt found myself doing anything good for me and my family because I was not earning well. 

In 2018 start, A friend got in touch with me and suggested to do a business in search engine optimization where we will build websites ourselves and will sell it for a massive amount. So fell for it and started it with him. Site was doing good and everything was good I learned few things there as well. But then after 5 months my mind started getting negative vibes about that partner and decided to part out ways.

In 2018 mid, started my own business in same space and started building sites myself. First site was a success and earned a decent amount but it was a bad move to sell that site too early as if I‚Äôd have worked on it myself then I might have turned it into a big success. Anyway, I reinvested all the earned amount in two new sites and worked on it for more than one and a half year and none of them earned a penny and never got sold. I was at same place where I started at 2018. Meanwhile I got married in 2020 and within 6 months that relation ended up because married to wrong girl. It was her fault and divorce happened because everyone knew that it‚Äôs girl who‚Äôs in fault.

In 2021, started same business but with different partner and it earned good money for 8-9 months. I was spending money on household expenses only but my brother was spending a big chunk of money towards two major installments and I never kept a track of where I spend and how much. My contribution, never recognized ever. I don‚Äôt feel bad about it, because my brother was really supporting the family like a pillar.

Again that site got smashed by Google update and it never reach to a potential where we can sell it. Again a failure.

In 2022, decided to move to Canada for better life and opportunities. And applied and accepted for student visa.

Came here in Canada in 2023. I‚Äôm and I was a tobacco addict since age of 10 years. My brother never liked it and has always pushed me to work on that.

My studies were going on smoothly here and I was doing parttime job as well like everyone. 
I never tried weed or did alcohol but eventually one friend made me eat laddu mixed with weed. I abused that friend verbally and ended friendship with him right away. 

Last month I got married to a nice girl. She‚Äôs wise and smart but not much educated. Still I love her the most and it‚Äôs same from her side as well. We both like each other‚Äôs company and appreciate each other for being in each other‚Äôs life.

Since last few days I‚Äôm getting too much enxiety. I‚Äôm getting very negative thoughts about my life, my failures, the mess that I created where I‚Äôm still at a place where a person of 23 years is and I‚Äôm already 32. I feel like I‚Äôm worthless person who don‚Äôt have any ability to support his family. Who can‚Äôt do anything good technically. I‚Äôm still an elder son of family where a younger one is supporting family since last 5 years. Never contributed to family and neither worked on making my life a better thing.

Everyone thinks that I‚Äôm smart, but somewhere inside I feel that I‚Äôm not smart at all.
My brother thinks that I can be a programmer because I‚Äôve done that thing for 6 years in academics but I know that my logical abilities are not sound enough. I can do any physical job but that‚Äôs not good or enough for me at this time of age that too I know. I‚Äôm confused about everything.

I do just studies, my parttime shifts and don‚Äôt do anything beyond that. 

Never worked on my bad habits, never worked on my bad addiction, never worked on fitness. I just stay inside my room and try to find an internship and go to do studies at college and to do shifts at my workplace.

Also, now I created another mess and came drunk at home (it was my first time and I won‚Äôt do it again) 

My roommates informed my brother about it and now I‚Äôll be like an alcoholic to him. I‚Äôm already a burden for him. This thoughts were already haunting me since last many days and now I‚Äôm dragging him into my mess too‚Ä¶

Can someone please suggest me; why I‚Äôm a moron? Why I‚Äôm not doing anything good? Why I never tasted success in my life?

What I could do? Can I still improve myself or I‚Äôll die as failure only? 
Why I still don‚Äôt know purpose of my life?

Why I have never started to improve myself?

1j8k5dj,Can't decide if I just have a maladaptive coping mechanism or if something else is going on,Anxiety,1741673005.0,0,2,"So I (20m) have been dealing with this... thing in my mind for about three years. I say thing because I'm not sure what it is. I have diagnosed disorders, including dissociative tendencies, but I also have an over active imagination, along with a lovely history of multiple sources of trauma. I am barely getting over said trauma and I am becoming aware of maladaptive coping mechanisms that I have developed over time. 

About three years ago during a period of involuntary social withdrawal (emotionally unstable mother/always sucked at being social appropriate/kids at school turned out to be liars) if about a year I wrote a random silly story and I drew one of the characters. And well I thought he looked pretty hot, and instantly I fell in love with this drawing. It wasn't a remarkable drawing, just a doodle. I immediately started fantasizing about a life with this man, had nothing to do with the story, I just fell in love with how he looked, and I created someone in my mind I could fantasize about, and how much I would've loved for him to come get me out of my unfortunate circumstances. And this persisted, I said at the beginning that I was in complete control of it and as long as I wasn't having hallucinations then it wasn't anything concerning. Well obviously it spiraled out of control, more and more I just wanted to find *him*, wherever he was, so that he could help me get my life together, and I started to believe he was real. I imagined every way we could meet, and I always was thinking of him, and waiting, and how my life would be happy and he would be there. 

Well I haven't always had the best luck with dating, and that wasn't changing any time soon, you don't need to be dating when you're a teenager, but I was a dropout. Whenever I was able to go out, I was always looking for him around the corner, but he was never there. I went off to job corps, and was obsessed with hoping he would be there, and nothing could prevent us from being together, I began to believe he was real, I began to imagine his memories, I made up his whole life and I started to convince myself it was real, and that he was coming, I just had to wait. Well whoopsies got kicked out(no I'm not telling) on my 18th birthday, got sent home right to the pit of my trauma, and it took me three months to get a grip on myself, acknowledge that I was a damn adult, and I hopped out the window to go be homeless cus my mom was not ready for me to independent at all, but she was only making mental dysfunction even worse and it was the best option for me. Well now I was out on the streets, running around with this delusion of a savior partner, if only we would meet, and I started getting connected with resources that would help me get on my feet, and two months later I got myself a job, but whoopsies, burned out too hard because my mental health was still junk and couldn't handle working, had adequate work performance for 7 months, except for all the gaps when I didn't, and then at the end I was given an ultimatum and I quit. Took the last paycheck and drove six hours to a whole new town, convinced myself he must be there, oh yes I didn't stop thinking every day that I just had to keep working and he would show up and my life would ""begin"" and I wouldn't have to worry about a financial or companionship need ever again. Lol, that still wasn't in the cards for me, and I slept in my car for three weeks waiting for him to show up, very embarrassing looking back now, and well because he's not real, he's not real at all, he has never breathed a breath of air, he didn't show up. Week long phsyc ward visit later and I took this ring I had gotten for him and I threw it off a bridge, really wish I would've waited longer to try to sell it but oh well. And it had been a whole year of homelessness between the two towns combined and I got myself into a transitional living facility, and started working on dismantling this thing.

During this time I fought tooth and nail with myself to force myself into any relationship that was at least with an actual person, lol nope still not in the cards for me, so I gave up on dating apps or hookups, I really did try to be social in public too, but I couldn't seem to find anyone in my age range, so I've just thrown my arms up and given up on even trying. I forgot to mention that beyond the delusions of thinking this man was real, I also believed he was God and that I had a duty to love him to restore power to God so that I could escape Earth, that whole thing in the middle, very embarrassing. I told a therapist that I had(past tense) delusions of grandeur and he remarked that usually people don't break their own delusions, well I did, so that's that. I mention this because there was very much an alleged spiritual aspect to this, or at least I thought so, but everything has pointed me in the direction of ""no he's not real or your soul mate, drop it"" which I am trying to do, but I can't. And that's my problem.

I moved up to live with family in a third town, and I'm going to college, my grades are good and I'm getting better each day. But he's still there. I've tried all sorts of prayer, I've tried to villanize him, I've tried to ignore urges to seek him out, I've tried so much to make myself understand that just because my mom was unhinged that doesn't mean the rest of my family is, I've tried to surround myself with social support so that I won't feel like thinking of him, but he's always there, always there to hold me, always there to accompany me. Now let me be clear, I have never had a visual/auditory hallucination in my life. I have never spoken to him, and he has never spoken to me, he exists entirely within my imagination. And that's what's bothering me, and what has led me to believe that he is just a maladaptive coping mechanism, my brain provided me a companion during a very traumatic and isolated part of my life and now I can't make him go away, he is going to be there until he is no longer needed. And I don't think that's fair, I don't think it's fair that I can't figure out what this thing is, that both mental and spiritual work has not gotten rid of him, how could it? I structured my whole survival off of finding him, I imagined a life time together with him. When I say I thought of him all the time, I meant it, I wanted him every minute of the day. I've gotten far enough over the last year to at least be willing to say he's not real, but there's still that part of me that is holding out for him, and I just want it gone, I want that energy and hope to help in other parts of my healing, I don't want to hold on to it anymore, I don't know what's wrong with me, and I'm tired of having to restart therapy because I keep moving and now I'm in a small ass town that doesn't have a wide variety of therapists to choose from, not anyone who's specially trained for whatever is wrong with me, and this damn imaginary friend/dissociative business always gets steamrolled by all the other damn trauma I still haven't processed and I don't know how to get help for it because I can't even label it, it's treatment resistant, I refuse to take antipsychotics because I do not have schizophrenia and when I was placed on Abilify wayyy before this whole business started (about 9 months before that fateful date for 7 days, forced on to me because I kept ""lashing out"" and yelling at my mom because she victimized me) I felt awful, constant leg tremors and fatigue that made me actually unstable, and I feel like restricting my dopamine would just kill my personality, I think it would kill ""me"". Antidepressants (SSRI's/SNRI's) do not work on me at all, tried them for years and years and only got fat from them, (they also don't work if you're actually stuck in a traumatic living environment where you're constantly exposed to hopelessness/helplessness) antianxiety meds actively make me depressed, and all I got out of this is an OCD diagnosis, still don't know what to do with it. 

I just- I don't need a relationship, having one entirely in my mind has just burned me out. But he's still there, to fill in the gaps whenever some part of me calls out to him, always a loyal companion, taunting me with what I can't have. I wish I could look at my family and feel cared for. I wish I could sit by myself without dissociating/daydreaming. I wish I could pin point what this was, and make it stop. He won't go away until he is no longer needed, but you know that idea of ""if you keep wishing for something you're not gonna get it""? Well I believe that, and I believe that I just don't get to have a relationship in this life, not as long as he won't go away. I want him gone because I now believe he is stopping me from enjoying life and recovering. Or should I just accept it? Should I stop feeling so distressed about his presence? I just get so sad cuddling with my pillows, I don't want to be so obsessed with a romantic relationship, I wish I could believe my family and friends when they say they care, I want to live life in the moment, and not in some far off place in my mind. My psych was thinking of looking into drug based therapies since I believe in medical marijuana, but in the meantime I just don't know what to do with myself.",i cant cope
1i88sao,"Overwhelmed by stress/anxiety, feels like I can't cope",Anxiety,1737653385.0,2,1,"Contains vague talk of medical things, but is not specifically related to medical anxiety.  May still be upsetting/triggering in this regard though!



Hello all, recently my partner has been dealing with serious (but not life-threatening) medical problems related to his eyes, and is undergoing treatment.  We both have anxiety disorders, and both have a habit of feeding off of the other's.

Between insurance companies being as difficult as possible, his job being as difficult as possible about leave approval for appointments, and then, you know, the actual process, fears, processing, etc...  I am not handling it well.  (He is not either but I'm not here to speak for him)

I have just been absolutely emotionally overwhelmed for days, weeks.  Waking up with my heart pounding, expecting bad news in every message or strange look.  Panic attacks.  Catastrophizing.  Often on the verge of tears.  I still manage to get through my work day, but I feel like I'm screaming into a void, because I feel like I can't talk to anyone about this (it's not my stuff to share + everyone in my circle is dealing with their own things, and I don't want to burden them further with just my aimless anxiety), and I feel bad feeling bad because it doesn't feel like I have the right.  I also don't really have any local friends to go out with (making friends is just so hard!).  I don't want him to have to feel like he's taking care of me or worrying about me, but I also absolutely cannot hide it (and don't REALLY want to because I know it's counterproductive).

It just gets worse when I see him stressed out, because I feel bad for him, which makes me spiral even more.  But I obviously would never ask him to not show it either, so I know that it's my -reaction- that is the issue.  But I just can't control it.

I know I have problems/a history of being a feelings manager.  I want my friends to have a good time, I want to do the things that I know won't upset people.  I have recognized this more recently, and I know that ultimately I am not responsible for how other people react to things... But not internalizing that is easier said than done.

I have mostly just been trying to distract myself, because I know that I have no direct, actionable impact in this situation.  I try to be supportive, give hugs, make good dinners, listen, etc., and that's probably all that I can do.  But it's also slowly just eating away at me as well, and I feel like I just have to sit in it and suffer, because I'm not actually the person who is going through anything.

I don't currently have a therapist, tho I have had a couple in the past.  They helped to varying degrees and equipped me with tools that usually do ok for me overall, for smaller triggers, or just general anxiety.  But as soon as there is a real, logical cause of stress/anxiety, I just become totally incapable of coping, probably because a lot of those tools involve putting things into perspective/using logic to recognize it's anxiety talking.  That just doesn't work for me when there are actual, real, tangible events happening.

Tldr: I'm overwhelmed by stress/anxiety caused by medical things with my partner, who is also overwhelmed.  I don't know how to cope with anxiety with a tangible cause, regardless of not being able to have any real effect on it.

While any tips would be lovely, even just knowing I'm not alone here would also mean the world.",i cant cope

1c3bis5,I just can't cope anymore ,Anxiety,1713040612.0,11,7,"
I'm at the stage in my life where people are doing normal life stuff and hitting certain milestones in their life. 

I see people getting engaged, getting married, having children. And it really makes me look back on my life, how I am, who I was, what I had to deal with and what I missed out on. 

I'll never have a best friend to call. I dont have anyone to do anything with other than my partner. I'll never join any friendship groups because im ""boring"". I'll never attend a hen party because I have zero friends. I'll never have a hen party because i have no one to attend. I'll never have a normal wedding because I dont have a group of people that love me, not even family. I don't think I'll ever have children because im terrified of being an awful mother, im scared they'll go through what ive been through, im scared they won't have a normal life. I'll never have a birthday party or have friends to call when I need something or have a group of people that love me. I have my partner. I have no one else. 

Seeing people do these things makes me reflect on my life and my current state. It makes me wish I was a different person and picks out all my flaws. I'm unable to be a normal functioning member of society, I can't dance, sing, talk, connect or have any form of attention on myself in groups of people. I sit there and over analyse every movement I make, I kick myself for not being ""normal"" or more fun. When it comes to upcoming events and I tend to think more about how I'll be sat there wishing I could get up and sing, dance, have fun and chat with people. And it makes me so fucking sad. It makes me think about what a waste of life I have and is there any point even continuing. 

Im lonely as fuck, my mental health is increasingly getting worse as I get older. I struggle with depression, anxiety, emotional dysregulation and probably more but my doctor won't help me any further. (I just need to take some pills).

I used to drink and take substances to cope with situations that made me uncomfortable and they used to help with making me appear more normal. I could talk, have fun without looking at myself from the outside. But now I dont drink or take substances, I'm struggling with fitting in. I'm even anxious about drinking in front of other people now and even anxious about being around drunk people. 

I grew up in an emotionally abusive household, had to deal with certain things as a child and its completely ruined me. My father wanted nothing to do with me, his girlfriend was abusive and used to make her children bully/ beat me up whenever I stayed at theirs, she would also come into my room at night and whisper that my father wasn't my father anymore and he was hers, she posted dead animals though our letter box. My mother was judgemental, mean and I was made to feel more like her partner than a daughter, my step dad was a narcissistic abusive alcoholic man. I raised my siblings (I feel guilty about leaving them behind). I experience SA during my childhood and teenage years. I drank alcohol from the age of 13, picked up smoking and started taking substances to cope with things. 

I kind of miss being young, troubled and a mess. Even though it wasn't healthy to be out drinking and doing all those things at a young age and i was surrounded by toxic older people, at least I had fun. I partied, I was messy and I didn't care. 

I had to do awful things to save myself from my childhood home and I had to do things to help me to move out on my own. I was made to feel worthless, stupid, ugly, a slut, a bad person, and so much more in my home. A home that is supposed to be safe. I left and I left everything behind. I dont have friends from school or college or university. They didn't stick around. I just floated from friends or groups but I feel like i was never truly allowed into the inner circle. 

In my 30+ years of being on this planet I have never made life long connections with people. I struggle deeply to let people in and due to my childhood/ teenage years I hung around with awful people. And it really makes me wonder what the fuck have I done with my life. It makes me really reevaluate if life is worth continuing because its so fucking shit. 

I hate seeing posts online about how the challenges we face make us stronger, because it doesn't and that's not the reality. I face daily challenges because of this, its made me weaker not stonger. And im sick of it all.",i cant cope

16thenk,"How I Overcame DPDR (symptoms, feedback loop, anxiety, my story, tips & advice)",Anxiety,1695812196.0,284,684,"Hi everyone, I really wanted to do/felt like I should make a separate master-post for how I overcame DPDR (depersonalization and derealization) that was triggered by long-term anxiety, as well as some of the symptoms, mechanisms of DPDR, feedback loop, triggers & more.

I made a previous master-post on my long-term anxiety symptoms (which I overcame) where I went over the more bizarre, rarely spoken about, constant symptoms of long-term anxiety, and the feedback loop and it seemed to help a lot of people. I will link that one below, I recommend everyone read it first!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10jcfko/longterm_anxiety_symptoms_i_had_from_someone_who/

A lot of you wanted to know how I overcame the DP/DR symptoms. I didn't realise that I had message requests on Reddit, and now I've got so many spanning across months ago that I can't find the time to get back to individually so I feel like its my duty to make this post and have it all in one place. Warning, this is a big post.

Lets go over some positives first as I find its always best to get off on a positive note, and to have something to look forward to or motivate others:

**1. DP/DR (Depersonalization and Derealization) is not and is never permenant, anyone who says so are catastrophizing and are probably biased or feeling that way due to their own condition not improving. These notions are not helpful and are also not true.**

**It will and can go away 100%, it is not something you have to 'deal' with or 'accept' for the rest of your life.**


**2. DP/DR does not work like a debt system e.g. the longer you are in DP/DR, the longer it is going to take you to get out of it (isn't true!). Everyone has the same chance of success in recovering from DP/DR, no matter how long or short you have been in that state.**
**3. DP/DR is not indicative or a sign of psychosis, and you will not become psychotic if you experience DP/DR.**


DP/DR is a **defense mechanism**, which attempts to make sure that only the body experiences pain or trauma and not the mind, by causing detachment. **Causes of DP/DR can be anxiety attacks, severe stress, health anxiety, drug induced (often from edibles or hallucinogens), traumatic first-hand or second-hand situations, abuse or any interpersonal trauma. Anyone of any age can experience DP/DR.**

.......................................................................

**What does DP/DR feel like?:**

- Everything feels (and looks) either too close or too far away from you, environments are distorted
- Everything feels flat or 2D, like it isn't quite real or tangible, others faces might feel unreal
- Can feel like the world is slipping away from you
- You might feel like you could fall over any second or fall through the floor
- Speech can feel slow/slurred, like your brain is struggling to find words
- Time can feel like its going too fast or too slow
- Feeling like you can observe yourself outside your body, everything feels disconnected, like you are very alone
- Your limbs can feel too small, too big, like you are taller or shorter than you actually are
- You might feel internally dizzy (like your mind is spinning but your vision isn't), woozy head feelings, fuzzy head
- More frequent feelings of nostalgia/dejavu
- Colours can feel more dull or distorted
- Feeling numb, like your memories are less tangible or unreal
- Hypochondria (Healthy Anxiety) is often a huge comorbidity with DP/DR

.......................................................................

**The Feedback Loop, what is it?**

Symptoms of DP/DR (as well as Anxiety/Health Anxiety) are often kept alive by or started something called the **Feedback Loop.** This is a loop that is constantly being fed into, which could have started from something as for example:

*You may be minding your own business one day and suddenly experience a Panic Attack, but you misread it as being something worse. You could think you're about to die, that you are having a heart attack because of the palpitations, that you could collapse any moment now, and then it goes... but you're on edge, what if it happens again? Do I have a heart condition? I think I'm dying, I think something is wrong. Everyday you are waking up and checking if you can feel palpitations, you're scared it will happen again, you're getting waves of dread, your mind is full of 'what ifs' over and over again every single day. Then one day, nothing feels real and you feel completely detached from reality and this scares you even more, you feel like you're slipping away, you're terrified and feel like you'll never be normal again. You're waking up everyday to check if everything still feels unreal, and it does, its not going away. Whats happening?*


This is the **Feedback Loop** example which led to DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms. What should've happened when you experienced for example: a Panic Attack, was that **you should've been able to realise it was a Panic Attack and been able to ground yourself or calm down during that situation and it would go away. This would eliminate the start of the Feedback Loop**, but instead by misreading the situation or not having the appropriate tools to manage it, you are now in fear, in high stress and feeling traumatised of the situation in fear it will happen again or that something worse is happening to you. This keeps the Loop alive and going.

**In preparation for the pain or fear you are about to anticipate happening, your body chose to disassociate from your mind and cause DP/DR in order to handle the stress and fear of what you're afraid of experiencing. DP/DR is attempting to save you from what could happen to you next, after being activated from something that already hurt you or traumatised you.**

Identifying the first source of your DP/DR can be particularly important in understanding and learning where your Feedback Loop started. **For some people it can even extend to as far as childhood, which can sometimes result in something known as DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)**. Once you have identified the source, this is the stepping stone into recovering from DP/DR.

Sources of DPDR can be: drug-induced from hallucinogens/edibles/bad trips/alcohol or other substances, anxiety attacks, depression, stress, medical trauma/childhood trauma/adulthood trauma/being a child of divorce, sexual assaults/CSA, PTSD, DID and more

Environments are also very important to be recognised as sources of DPDR e.g. stressful jobs, stressful/abusive relationships, difficult home life, being a full-time carer for family, difficult school life etc

.......................................................................

**So what's going to help me get better?**

There's a lot of resources and therapies available for DP/DR, such as Psychotherapy (talking therapies), CBT, DBT, EMDR and more.

But what is most important is that you are able to help yourself, as well as having professional support should you require it. **The thing that is going to get you better the most is you, and the tools you can develop to help you in time of need and in how you navigate the world and your trauma**. Some people (like me) may be able to recover from DP/DR without professional intervention or therapies, but it is always incredibly recommended if you have access or can afford it. **With DP/DR being highly trauma related, it is important to have a safe place to unload and traverse trauma with a professional**, as it can be tough to handle alone. **If you are concerned or suspect your DP/DR may be a result of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder), professional help is absolutely necessary.**

Every person with DP/DR will be completely unique in their needs, what they can handle alone or what they need support with.

.......................................................................

**What can we do for ourselves?**

This is going to go over some self-practices and tools you can do in your own time to help yourself while actively experiencing DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms, and also how to reduce the chances of re-experiencing it when you are recovered.

**Staying Busy & Challenging Yourself:**

A big part of dissolving the Feedback Loop is by no longer feeding into it, and one way of doing this is by diverting our thoughts from the feelings of DP/DR or anxiety symptoms. **You want to find or make opportunities where you don't have time to think about DP/DR, or how it makes you feel, 'scanning' for feelings or signs of it, and to challenge those feelings instead.**
**DP/DR and anxiety is the perfect time to get busy and involved with life**, whether it is your hobbies, being with your friends and family, doing chores that need to be done, starting things you've always wanted to do. **It can feel scary, even terrifying to partake in these things when you feel unreal, like you're not present or that the world is slipping away, but you must keep pushing through**. Once you begin to challenge yourself and challenge those feelings of 'not feeling real' you begin to establish trust within yourself.

**Don't be disheartened that DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms do not disappear right away overnight, this is because your body hormonally, needs time to acclimate to low levels of stress and anxiety after having been kept at such high levels. If these hormones were to plummet immediately, the body wouldn't be able to cope, so it likes to decline it gently! So consider it like you are establishing trust:**

DP/DR has been in the drivers seat all this time, and you've been the passenger in the back. You're finally insisting on being in the driver's seat, but DP/DR insists on being the passenger right next to you. DP/DR is going to freak out in the passenger seat and take the wheel from you at times during some tough situations because its not sure you can navigate it on your own, and instead of letting it take the driver's seat again you need to say to it, 'Don't worry. I've got this'. and DP/DR will let go of the wheel. This in real life, would be an example of you handling the situation you are in and challenging yourself to face what makes you afraid (such as going outside in case you feel 'unreal').

**By doing this, you are establishing trust and are giving DP/DR the opportunity to know that you can handle the situation on your own. Eventually with time of practicing these things, DP/DR will get out of the car entirely and you can 'drive' all by yourself again and those feelings of DP/DR will be gone. You'll be able to live your life without things like anxiety or DP/DR dictacting where it takes you or how it makes you feel. You will have formed that trust that you can handle experiencing your pain, your fear, your trauma, your anxiety/stress etc. without the need of the defence mechanism of DP/DR. You will become the first line of defence!**

From personal experience this is what accelerated me to my complete recovery from DP/DR and long-term anxiety symptoms within 3-4 months of this practice after struggling for almost a year of non-stop DP/DR and anxiety symptoms. **I learned to empathise with my DP/DR's attempt at trying to keep me safe and acknowledged that it was only doing this in order to make me feel better, albeit in a scary and inconvenient way! So by learning techniques and also teaching myself not to be scared of DP/DR symptoms or my anxiety symptoms, I gave myself the opportunity to be the one in control and say ''Hey, I am totally capable of caring for myself now. Thank you for your help and what you tried to do for me'' to my DP/DR.**

By feeling afraid to participate in activities or doing things because you might feel unreal, or because the world feels distorted, you are allowing DP/DR to maintain control and are keeping DP/DR as an option

**Challenge yourself in incriments or in steps, and remember to reward yourself afterwards. Figure out what about DP/DR makes you afraid:**

**is it seeing people's faces? particularly friends or family?** - challenge yourself towards looking at faces, engaging with familiar faces (YouTubers, family, partners), if you can touch their face then touch it, grounding exercises where you say ''I can see two eyes, they are [insert colour], they have a [description] nose, do they have freckles? birth marks? do they have any smile lines? identify parts of their face and describe them'' this helps make them more tangible and less scary. Do little challenges before the bigger ones.

**is it going outside in case you feel unreal? woozy?** - challenge yourself towards small, short walks up and down your street, to eventually longer walks, acknowledge that you might be feeling dizzy/unreal but that you are safe, be kind & go home if you need it, try again another day, stay engaged with your hobbies/the outside world

**is it the feeling that you'll never be the same again? that you think its permenant? that you've ruined your life?** - The first thing you'll see if you look up 'can dpdr be permenant' is 'no!' and every other article will say no. There has never been an observed case of DPDR being permenant, and you won't be the first case of that happening. Its really important you do not entertain or engage with people who believe it is permenant, or that theirs is permenant because they are just people who are keeping their own DPDR alive with the negativity. I recommend writing positive affirmations or reading them, and engaging with positive stories of DPDR recovery and sticking with facts. **You have not ruined your life, and you will recover.**
**DPDR can make you feel afraid of lots of things, not just the ones I described above (but those are the most common).**

**Grounding Exercises:**
Grounding is a way to refocus and bring your attention back to the present and the world around you. This is can be used when experiencing fear or anxiety of your current DP/DR state, but is **most effective when you feel like it is 'coming on' or you are experiencing anxiety/stress that could lead to it.**

Grounding exercises can involve:

- Naming 5 things you can see, name 4 things you can touch and to touch them, naming 3 things you can hear and listening to them, what 2 things can you smell, 1 thing you can taste.
- Holding ice cubes, putting your hands in cold water, picking up or touching things and explaining how it feels (is it cold, warm, does it feel rough or soft), identifying their colours deeply
- Walks without music, tuning into the sounds of your steps, counting your steps, observing your surroundings on your walks, sitting in the grass and touching it.
- Mental anchoring by saying (in your head or quietly to yourself) your full name, your age, where you live, what street you live on, the date, where you are, what you're doing. Repeat this gently until you feel calm.
- Self-assurance phrases such as, ''You are okay'', ''Nothing can hurt me'', ''You will get through this'', ''I've done this once and I can do it again'' etc.

.......................................................................

**My Example of How I Personally Recovered from DPDR:**

For me I dealt with a lot of wooziness/dizziness during my DP/DR and I felt terrified to do anything sitting up or standing because I'd have to acknowledge that dizzy feeling and the unreal-ness from DP/DR, so I would lie on my side all day while watching TV or playing games instead to cope. **I wanted to turn 'Oh god, no I'm dizzy and woozy and nothing feels real, I'm so scared' into 'Oh I'm dizzy and feel unreal today? Lets see what I can manage'.**

It started to become more of 'Let's get up! Lets engage with the same hobbies but lets sit up this time'. I'd do that for as long as I feel I could handle the dizzines and unreal sensations, and then I'd lie back down again. I rewarded myself and cared for myself with a technique that brought me comfort, while having succeeded in engaging with something that scared me or was difficult. Over time I'd start to sit up for longer, or I'd start to go outside on short walks (which was particularly hard as I'd feel more unreal outside than at home), and I would feel unreal, like everything was flat, like the world was slipping away but I did it.

Some days I would just cry or feel like I took steps back, that I'd be stuck forever but I kept going and I kept rewarding myself after those times with either little lie downs, eating things I really loved, engaging in self-care or watching familiar TV shows I know I loved. Over time I started to sit up a lot more, I started to stand more, I started to go out more and for much, much longer each time, I started to do all the things I loved again despite how I felt. **Don't get me wrong, I still felt unreal and dizzy but I wanted to stop being scared of it and to not let it stop me engaging with things I loved or wanted to do.**

**I stopped basing my days and thoughts on 'how good I'm feeling' and more so on 'how well can I manage today'.** That took away a lot of pressure for me, as I knew I would not feel better over night but I would learn to manage my days better, so focusing on that intrinsically helped me feel better. You'll want to learn how to manage bad days (whether DPDR days, anxious days, stressful days) because when you do, you'll become prepared for if you ever face any of those times again and you can conquer it!

One day after months of challenging myself, being more present, doing my hobbies, going outside (I remember this vividly) I was hugging my partner and I looked up at his face and I physically jumped, **he looked real. I started looking around everywhere and everything felt real, everything looked so colorful, the world didn't feel flat or distorted, everything felt 'real' and 'right' and when I touched my partner's face it felt so tangible and real.** I don't think I've ever cried that hard in my life from happiness, my DPDR was gone.

Everything probably felt like this for a while, but because I was so engrossed in engaging with the world around me and doing the things I loved I didn't actually realise it, because I was no longer questioning my reality or looking for signs of DP/DR. **So that one moment where I finally remembered to 'check' my reality, it made me realise everything felt real again and that I felt human again. And it never came back.**

When you feel ready, the key is to be kind to yourself as well as challenge yourself against your DPDR and how it makes you feel. By pushing through and engaging with the world around you bit by bit you will start to establish that trust, those tools, in convincing your body that you can handle yourself and that it no longer needs to detach with DPDR to keep you safe.

.......................................................................

**Some habits to get into, and some to get rid of:**

- **Cut out all alcohol and all drugs absolutely and completely, as well as caffeine & reduce or quit smoking.** All of these substances will have an effect on the hormones in your body, and can impede progress from DP/DR due to the sensations it can produce and will generally stress out the body, and mind-altering drugs like hallucinogens or Cannabis can worsen DP/DR greatly or keep it around. *If you are an addict or suffer from addictions, get in touch with services that can help you taper, detox or navigate potential sobriety, do not attempt any of this alone.*

- **Establish a normal bedtime routine**, ideally getting into bed at 9-10pm and waking up before 9am. Some people need more sleep than others so wake up at whatever time in the morning before 9am is best for you; getting adequate sleep will greatly improve the rate of which your DP/DR can dissolve as your mind will be most lucid, alert and prepared to handle potential stressors. **Sleeping too much or too little can greatly affect your brain and hormone regulation, and you need the best hormone regulation in order for the body to lower cortisol levels which leads to DP/DR symptoms rapidly improving.**

- **Stay hydrated and well-fed.** This is really typical mental health advice, but in general you will want to make sure you are hydrated and well-fed so the body has enough energy supply to handle stressors, anxiety and to ensure the mind is as lucid and energised as possible. You will need all the energy you can possibly get, and having these bases covered can really improve your symptoms.

- **Get checked for any Vitamin Deficiencies** as a lot of Vitamins we can be deficient in will greatly effect circadian rhythms, heart rhythms, the brain (deficiencies can cause brain fog, low motor skill function and poor hormone regulation). **Making sure we have healthy, functioning foundations to work off of greatly supports mental function and our ability to take on new information and learn new things (such as therapeutic tools and treatment).**

- **Identify your stressors and reduce them, identify your triggers and navigate them.** Cortisol levels increase with stress (from stressors) and anxiety, when we are faced with high levels of cortisol for extended periods of time, the body can produce bizzare and scary symptoms (which are harmless).

zc2m3n,Got cured of Generalized Anxiety Disorder! Here's what worked for me!,Anxiety,1670135486.0,171,1092,"Hey guys, I have been an avid follower of this sub for a long time and this place has been a constant source of panic attack relievers over the last few months. In my last session with my therapist, he told me that GAD is cured after 6 months of literal hell and dedication. I want to share what worked for me.

**Background:** As with my fellow GAD sufferers, I have been suffering from constant worries and usual panic attacks over the last few years but I decided to take action about this (didn't know it was GAD back then) after a full-blown attack that lasted for hours and hours in early May this year. Started my treatment late May. In one of the panic attacks I was contemplating committing suicide but thank god I had the courage to stick to my routine.

**Symptoms:** Luckily, never had any physical symptoms but diarrohea and mouth ulcers were common because of cortisol developed by Amygdala.

**Aftermath:** I am waking up everyday with a buoyant mood and my life including social life, dating life and academic performance, all have improved!

So, let's finally begin:

1. **Therapy:** Can't emphasize this more, CBT therapists will identify the problematic and impractical thought patterns associted with your Anxiety( especially if it's Cortex-based) and suggest you ways to cope with them via ABCDE, RRR techniques and so on. Some of these will work for you will and some not but these people are medical experts and you need to spend 2-3 months with a therapist before deciding to discontinue/move to a different Therapist. Self-therapy books do help but it's always better to have someone in the form of close friend or a therapist to assist in your journey.
2. **Reading Books:** Rewire your Anxious Brain, The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety, and My Age of Anxiety,  are the top 3 books I recommend. Finally, I'd suggest reading posts on this sub. **Caution:** there are chances of feeling uneasiness or having panic attacks by reading few content so make sure you tell your brain that this is medicine beforehand
3. **Meditation:** atleast 2-3 times in a day for 12.5 mins everyday. It's only one day in the last 6 months I missed doing this wonderful thing.Buddhist style of meditation worked for me. Mantra meditation, guided meditation are other alternatives. There are wide variety of resources available online. It could be possible that you don't see the effects in the initial few weeks but I'd suggest keep doing it blindly.
4. **Gym:**  6 days a week non-stop in the last 6 months except for the weeks when I was travelling. It's scientifically proven that doing physical activity for more than 20 mins almost everyday improves mental health. Technically, doing exercises helps the body release endorphins that rearrange the synapse between the neurons if done for 10 weeks to see a significant results. This is massive in improving thought patterns
5. **Being open:** Being open about your anxiety with your closed ones will enable to learn new strategies, perspectives and many more things. More importantly, you will have shoulders to fall upon during a full-blown panic attack

**Others:** practicing gratitude daily, practicing my hobbies( soccer).

I can't help but look up these extremely triggering studies on the internet which state that highly anxious people are more likely to suffer from cardiac arrest. That stuff doesn't help at all.

It was probably due to how to explained it, but I ended up leaving that appointment feeling stuck. That this was a big deal to me, but maybe I was overreacting to something I should've been celebrating.

But anyways, the biggest issue I have with this sudden shift is that there's odd restlessness I'm struggling to put words to.

Before the age of 18, I wasn‚Äôt like this at all‚Äîeverything I‚Äôm about to describe just wasn‚Äôt me back then. But during these years, I‚Äôve slowly changed, and I don‚Äôt know why.

Socializing used to be easy, but now it feels like a chore. I don‚Äôt enjoy it anymore because I overthink everything. Before a conversation, I think about what I should say. During it, I monitor myself, wondering if I sound weird or if I‚Äôm saying the right things. After it, I replay everything in my head, analyzing whether it went well. I never used to do this.

Now, I sometimes find myself zoning out completely, just staring at nothing, my mind blank. When people talk to me, I don‚Äôt always have responses. I just say ""yes,"" ""no,"" ""really,"" ""oof"", short and empty answers, even when I want to say more. I wasn‚Äôt like this before. I used to be engaged in conversations, I could flow naturally, joke, and actually enjoy talking to people.

My memory feels off too. I struggle to recall words when speaking, and I can‚Äôt remember conversations well‚Äîit‚Äôs like they disappear from my mind right after they happen. Even when I read or learn something new, it doesn‚Äôt stick like it used to. My thoughts feel fast but disorganized, like they‚Äôre just noise in my head, not full ideas.

I also worry about how I come across all the time‚Äîif I‚Äôm saying the right thing, if I sound smart, if I seem normal. I even think about eye contact too much, like ‚Äúam I holding it too long?‚Äù or ‚Äúshould I look away now?‚Äù It‚Äôs exhausting, and it makes me feel even more disconnected.

My confidence dropped so much over these four years, probably by 70%. I doubt myself constantly, and I don‚Äôt speak with confidence anymore. I feel less competent than other people‚Äîon a social level, on a critical thinking level, on every level.

January : Psych attempted switch to Duloxetine and stop Mirtazapine because Mirtazapine wasn't helping my anxiety. After three days, first panic attack in years appeared (this is when it all went down hill). Stopped Duloxetine and restarted Mirtazapine.

February : Psychiatrist reintroduced Zoloft 25 for a week. After three days panic attacks and a really horrible feeling of impending doom. Went to ER and told to stop Zoloft and start Mirtazapine. Calmed down, but very on edge.

-beginning of the feeling this is just never going to stop-

Psychiatrist thought maybe I was having a mild serotonin syndrom and to stop Mirtazapine, lower Zoloft to 25 and added Olanzapine 2.5.

A week later, panic attacks are returning and they're worse than ever before. I feel as though I'm not in control of myself and horrible scenarios come into my head I don't want to follow (suicidal thoughts). They're not there when I'm not having a panic attack.
Not sleeping great at al neither since stopping Mirtazapine.

Can anyone relate near or far to my situation just to let me know that it will get better. I'm at my wits end and just cannot put up with this horrible internal unease much longer. 

I have no idea which medication is doing what. The only thing I suspect is really making me feel bad as it has from the start with or without Mirtazapine is Zoloft. The first time round I don't remember such horrible feelings. 
I had paroxetine 10 years ago and that worked great for anxiety/depression and PTSD.

1jn1u2p,"I‚Äôm 32, Broken, and Don‚Äôt Know How to Fix My Life. Please Help.",Anxiety,1743298786.0,0,3,"# Part 1: The Slow Unraveling

I don‚Äôt remember when it started. Maybe it was the first time I sat at my desk at 2 AM, debugging some garbage legacy code, realizing I hadn‚Äôt spoken to another human in 48 hours. Or maybe it was the moment I looked at my bank account and saw the number‚Äî*not*¬†my salary, but the total debt‚Äîand felt my stomach drop like a stone.

I‚Äôve been a programmer for almost a decade now. Not a¬†*great*¬†one, not a¬†*passionate*¬†one‚Äîjust‚Ä¶ functional. The kind of guy who gets the work done, but never stands out. The kind of guy who survives layoffs but never gets promoted. The kind of guy who watches his peers move up, move on, or burn out spectacularly, while I just‚Ä¶ exist.

And now, at 32, I‚Äôm standing in the wreckage of my own life, wondering how the hell I got here.

# Part 2: The Job That Isn‚Äôt a Career

I work for a mid-tier tech company. Not FAANG, not a startup‚Äîjust some corporate entity that pays me enough to keep me trapped but not enough to escape. Every day is the same:

* Wake up at 8:30 AM, already exhausted.
* Scroll through Slack messages, half of which are passive-aggressive reminders about deadlines.
* Try to focus while my brain screams at me about unpaid bills, aging parents, and the fact that I haven‚Äôt had a real vacation in years.
* End the day with a vague sense of dread, knowing I didn‚Äôt learn anything new, didn‚Äôt grow, just¬†*existed*¬†for another 8 hours.

I used to dream of building something meaningful. Now, I just pray my code doesn‚Äôt break in prod so I don‚Äôt have to explain myself in the post-mortem.

# Part 3: The Debt That‚Äôs Eating Me Alive

I owe¬†*so much money*.

* **Student loans**¬†‚Äì Because 18-year-old me thought a CS degree was a golden ticket.
* **Credit cards**¬†‚Äì Because 25-year-old me was depressed and tried to buy happiness.
* **Medical bills**¬†‚Äì ....
* **Personal loans**¬†‚Äì Because at some point, I started borrowing just to keep up.

Every month, I watch my paycheck dissolve before it even hits my account. Minimum payments. Interest. Late fees. It‚Äôs a treadmill, and I‚Äôm running as fast as I can, but the belt keeps speeding up.

I‚Äôve thought about bankruptcy. I‚Äôve thought about just‚Ä¶ disappearing. But I don‚Äôt even have the energy for either.

# Part 4: The Isolation

I live alone. My friends are all married, moved away, or just‚Ä¶ gone. My family thinks I‚Äôm doing great because I work in tech and ""must be making good money.""

I don‚Äôt date. I don‚Äôt go out. My social skills have atrophied to the point where even ordering food over the phone gives me anxiety. My only real human interaction is with my barista, and even then, I rehearse my order in my head three times before speaking.

I tried therapy. Couldn‚Äôt afford it after the third session.

# Part 5: The Fear of the Future

I‚Äôm not¬†*young*¬†anymore. The tech industry worships youth, and I‚Äôm already feeling obsolete.

* What happens when I‚Äôm 40 and still a mid-level dev?
* What happens if I get laid off and can‚Äôt find another job?
* What happens if my health fails? (I haven‚Äôt seen a doctor in years.)
* What happens if I wake up one day at 50 and realize I wasted my entire life?

I don‚Äôt have answers. Just fear.

# Part 6: The Small, Dark Thoughts

I won‚Äôt lie‚ÄîI‚Äôve had moments where I wondered if it would just be easier to¬†*not exist*. Not in a dramatic way, just‚Ä¶ a quiet exit. No more debt. No more deadlines. No more pretending I‚Äôm okay.

But I‚Äôm still here. Because somewhere, deep down, there‚Äôs a tiny, stubborn voice that says,¬†*""Maybe it doesn‚Äôt have to be like this.""*

# The Ask: How Do I Come Back from This?

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for. Maybe just‚Ä¶ someone who‚Äôs been here and found a way out.

* **If you dug yourself out of debt, how?**
* **If you escaped burnout, what did you change?**
* **If you rebuilt your life after feeling like a failure, where did you start?**

I‚Äôm so tired of being stuck. I don‚Äôt want a miracle‚Äîjust a¬†*path*.

Cancer, usually, but many times it will be other major things that are equally returned as a result from looking online about ""I have this minor issue, what could it be?"" type of searches. For the first few years I did all I could, I did tens, twenty, thirty hours of research every year for every little thing, and, for the first few years it gave me lots of stress.

Now though, I'm broken. I just resort to yelling after the fourth ""just look this up for me and if its good I'll stop worrying"" comes back with me saying ""you are fine because its only 'y', if it was anything worse, 'x', 'y', and 'z' would be happening"" and them totally ignoring what I come back to say. 

Unless if anything I say is slightly bad, they will utterly trust any notion that anything could be wrong from me, but refuse to trust if I say anything not negative.

So they had a huge panel, lots of blood draws. Their ""total protein"" was literally over in the smallest possible fashion, ""0.1 points"" over (one tenth of a point, the smallest change they show). They admit that they were very dehydrated, but say ""dehydration wouldn't cause such a big change.""

I respond, broken, after being badgered for days on end, by yelling ""WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN DEHYDRATION WOULND'T HAVE THAT BIG OF CHANGE?

1ja1tzy,I‚Äôm afraid my brain is broken,Anxiety,1741832996.0,2,1,"44M here. Spent over 20 years on Lexapro. I suffered a panic attack in my early 20‚Äôs and went 8 months feeling depersonalized and disconnected from myself, 24/7. After having every medical test under the sun done on my head, I finally noticed a pattern in how I felt: in crowds, I tended to feel worse. That was the hint that was needed. Saw a psychiatrist, got put on Lexapro, and my issue was resolved. I felt great! 

After a few years on Lexapro and living the wild life of a 20-something bachelor in the city, I wondered if I needed the drug anymore. I attempted to wean myself off and experienced horrible withdrawals that I was not prepared for. Back on I went. And that cycle continued for 20+ years. 

Fast forwarding to 2022, I was older and wiser, and fully knew how to wean and what to expect. I weaned off Lexapro over the course of several months and made it 7 months medication free! All was well. Until it wasn‚Äôt. 

I traveled to Canada from the US for a vacation and was stuck for 3 hours in line at the border. An annoyance, but not too big of a deal. Made it through stressed, but ok. But then my family and I got stuck in the hotel elevator for over 2 hours. I had a panic attack that lasted a few minutes at the beginning, but then came back down as I was focused on helping one of my kids who was in tears. On the way back to the US, I saw the loooong line for re-entry and was thrown into another panic attack. The next day, I was flying out to Las Vegas and experienced the worst turbulence I have ever felt. Things were flying all over the plane. Another panic attack. When I returned home, I noticed I started feeling weird after eating, and started getting anxiety regularly. 

Back on Lexapro I went. Something was different this time, though. It was more difficult to start than I remember from all previous times. It took me six months to be able to sleep well again. I also had random panic attacks that would wake me up in the middle of the night. Perhaps I just didn‚Äôt remember how bad things were in the beginning. In any case, I was on Lexapro for a year. Then, again, weaned myself off. Like going on, going off was far more difficult than I remember, but I made it. That was July, 2024. 

I made it through the acute withdrawal phase in early November. I still had occasional anxiety, but nothing too serious. So, I sought out a functional medicine doctor, thinking they could find the root cause of my anxiety and help me with this last little bit. I was put on several supplements. Nothing too crazy: multivitamin with a lot of B vitamins, vitamin D, magnesium, fish oil, and two products called RelaxMax and Immunitone. I was a wreck! They made everything worse. I tried to wean on slowly, but eventually I stopped sleeping and started having anxiety during the day. I quit the supplements, but the sleep issues continued. I would sleep for two hours, then wake up every one hour for the rest of the night. I haven‚Äôt had a solid night‚Äôs sleep since December 27th, 2024. 

Insomnia fed anxiety, anxiety fed insomnia, and the vicious cycle began. I became so desperate, and guilty for becoming so useless and crippled at home, that I sought out a psychiatrist again. However, this one recommended BuSpar instead of Lexapro. I figured I would give it a shot. 

I started with 5 mg once daily and felt near-immediate relief in anxiety. However, my sleep issues worsened. I was down to 45-60 minutes of sleep per night. After a few days, I began to get sleep anxiety. As soon as the sun went down, my anxiety would spike. I then went up to 5 mg, twice daily, per the psychiatrist‚Äôs orders. Sleep issues continued. Things culminated with two full days of complete fight or flight mode, no break. However, the night of day 2, I actually slept comparatively well. A four hour chunk, followed by a two hour chunk after being up for about an hour. The following day was great! At least compared to previous days. Then, that night of sleep was the same: 6 hours total‚Ä¶.with the help of trazodone and Xanax, that is, which my PCP told me to try for a week. 

However, sleep anxiety was still hitting me, and there was still some daytime anxiety. So I reached out to the psychiatrist and they upped my dosage to 10 mg, twice daily. That was yesterday. I slept one hour last night. 

I feel like I can‚Äôt handle this insomnia anymore and that I‚Äôm about to break. Those two nights of six hours of fragmented sleep seem like a miracle now. My mind is going everywhere. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm broken and I will never sleep well again. I‚Äôm scared I will be stuck with crippling anxiety and panic attacks forever. I‚Äôm scared for my family‚Äôs finances. I‚Äôve taken so much time off of work the past few weeks, we‚Äôre beginning to feel the financial toll. 

I also feel trapped. I‚Äôm two weeks into BuSpar now. I don‚Äôt want to start over with Lexapro, which I know works, but may exacerbate my already-horrible insomnia. Those six hour nights of sleep might have been me finally adjusting to the BuSpar dosage. But, like I said, I just started taking 10 mg now and am afraid I‚Äôm back in an adjustment period.

I thought writing all of this out might help me feel better. It didn‚Äôt. Lol. ",broken

i (16f) suffer from seveeeere hypochondria (self-diagnosed, I've seen a psychologist for it in the past but i didn't receive any further help). a week ago (3 weeks after contracting a pretty shitty covid infection with similar neuro complaints) i started getting a lot of tingling (along with other symptoms that don't really scare me as much). all over. it later on progressed into nerve like, burning/stinging pain on one side of my body - over one rib, in right thigh/knee area and forearm. i get some in the other side of my body as well, but they're milder and more transient. I've had other muscoskeletal pains, but you'll see why i don't really mind them. me, having severe health anxiety, especially around brain tumors, found a way to tie it to that. i discovered thalamic pain syndrome after a few googling episodes a couple days ago, and my anxiety has been through the roof since. i have basically neglected every other aspect of my life. i feel disconnected from that side of my body now - as if it's foreign, as if it reacts less to touch, temperature etc, although this isn't a constant feeling. i actually have that sort of ""dissociation"" pretty frequently with my HA. it's better when I'm calm. technically, so is the pain. i already went to a neuro, and was dismissed for this exact reason. i was told i was completely healthy, just anxious. but my pain hadn't started after any sort of anxiety/panic attack! (at least I think so?). my senses feel thrown off as a whole as well - I've become much more overstimulated over the tiniest things, irritable, my hearing feels like it's twice as strong.

anyway, after the neuro appointment, i didn't get a referral to anything aside vitamin testing. i decided to order myself an mri, without my parents' knowledge (they were unsupportive, my mom often bashes me for my anxiety badly, calls me insane etc). I'm so scared though. idek if I'm ready for a definitive diagnosis, let alone to have to share it with them. the statistics really scare me. atp I'm praying it's some neuropathy, or fibro, or even ms. anything but a brain tumor.

1d5t89q,"A bad THC trip has left me with permanent anxiety; or, a warning for people with anxiety to not underestimate edibles",Anxiety,1717265945.0,237,342,"#Long post warning. TL;DR I had a nightmare edible trip a few years ago and it seems to have permanently affected the way I react to weed and increased my daily general anxiety. Looking for similar experiences, hoping for some explanation or a happy ending.


Title says it all. This incident happened about two years ago. Here's what I can remember from the trip:

Background: I smoked a lot on and off since I was in my late teens (now in my 30s). Had a brief period of hard drug use, then my wife helped me clean up my act and my life has been pretty sweet and my overall anxiety had been quite low - for the past few years, I haven't had anything stronger than a beer and some weed and generally that was fine until this incident happened. I never, ever in my life had any sort of weed-induced anxiety save for one time in high school when we got chased by the cops through a park while stoned, but an hour later we were just laughing about the experience. I do have general and social anxiety disorder but weed never amplified that, in fact it was always the opposite where weed would calm me down and mellow me out. It was like a miracle drug. I never got stuck in my own head or anything like that until this happened. This is important to note: for the months leading up to this incident, I stopped smoking daily to focus on work, usually only getting stoned on the weekends. So my tolerance had dropped.


Drove into the city to see a movie. Hanging around outside beforehand, I took two edibles 20 minutes apart, each of which contained roughly 2g of some dispensary shit that had been mailed in to our state. They were peanut butter firecrackers. I completely fucked up the dosage and accidentally put in about ten times as much as I intended (I'm bad at math). That was my first mistake. I did not take into account the fact that I had a lower tolerance and just wanted to get ripped. So I gobbled them down and the die was cast. Someone I talked to estimated that I ingested at least 800mg of TCH. For reference, I think the dosage of most edibles these days for normal people hover around 10mg.

About 35 min later, we were sitting in the theater when the first one kicked in almost all at once. For about 3 minutes, I was giggling and feeling good. Then I realized I was way more stoned than I expected, it was kicking in too fast, my heart was thumping, and the second one hadn't kicked in yet. So the anticipation of how much higher I was about to get started to make me uncomfortable. My only thought was the second one hasn't kicked in yet, it hasn't kicked in yet, holy shit this is going to be a lot. My hands began to tingle and I got lightheaded and all of a sudden my heartbeat and breathing seemed way too loud to be normal.

I tried to calm myself by telling myself that I was in a movie theater and all I had to do was sit and distract myself with the movie, and that was when the paranoia started. I felt like everyone behind us was watching me. I started breathing really quickly and I was just about to lean over and tell my wife when the second one kicked in.

Just like the first one, the second edible hit me in the head all at once like a hammer. I blasted off. For a moment, all I could do was grip the arm rests as tightly as I could and wheeze through my nose, trying to control my breathing. I started drooling and sort of foaming at the mouth like a dog. My vision exploded into a kaleidoscope of color but they weren't pleasant colors, they were hostile and unnatural alien ones that only served to reinforce the idea that I was not in a comfortable and natural place. I felt like a space monkey locked in some hateful alien zoo. The small rounded lights on the walkways seemed to me like eyes which were staring furiously at me. I lost the ability to hear things and all I could sense out of my ears was a low, deep evil droning like a ship's foghorn. I covered my ears but it didn't help so I started shaking my head furiously, whispering no, no, no. At this point my wife looked over at me to see wtf I was doing and she saw that I was tripping out. She whispered something to me but I couldn't hear her because I had lost my ability to hear or discern human words. Her voice made no sounds but her teeth scared the shit out of me. They looked like the angry teeth of a shark. She rubbed my hand and noticed I was sweating bullets.

This was the last point where I noticed anything about the movie. I sat in there for 20 or so more minutes but despite watching the screen I had no idea what was happening and I might as well been like the dude from Clockwork Orange who was brainwashed with his eyes taped open. Right after the second one kicked in, I got stuck in a mental thought loop where I could not perceive any conscious thought other than this is your last day on earth over and over again. I probably thought the phrase over a thousand times as I sat there. The Beatles song ""A Day in the Life"" played on loop in my mind, but not the nice part, the scary, dissonant crescendo part. The only words in my mind I could hear were YOU'RE DYING, YOU'RE DYING, YOU'RE DYING again and again.

I had just enough of my wits left in me to realize that I was about to puke so I got up as normally as I could, wobbling and jerking, and just pretended there was nobody else in the theater as I made my way for the exit. As I walked, my vision began to fail. Black spots dotted my scope of vision and things were morphing and shifting before me. I held the handrail as tightly as I could and completely lost my frontal vision as soon as I saw the bathroom. So, the last 20 or so feet I had to walk sideways like a crab using my peripheral vision as I could no longer see out of the front, only the sides. I noticed one of the popcorn minions was watching me carefully so I had to consciously act like I wasn't a drug addled lunatic because I was terrified they'd call the cops (at the time, we lived in a non legal state).

Made it to the bathroom just as the second edible peaked. I'd wager it was abound 1 to 1.5 hours after ingestion, although it felt more like 5 or 6. I stumbled into a stall and puked my guts out. I convinced myself my puke was full of blood and freaked out some more. Then I sat down on the toilet and tried to control my breathing, but every time I did I'd remember that my guts were bleeding and hyperventilate some more. I was distracted for a moment when I thought I saw a camera hidden in the stall lock and panicked some more because I thought the people in the theater were watching me on their phones through the camera in the bathroom. This sent me into a spiral so I sat on the toilet for a while burying my face in my hands and crying. At this point, I was wholly convinced of my imminent death. There was no peace with it at all, only pure, blind, primal panic. Nothing but adrenaline and the pounding of my own heart in my ears.

This period where I was alone in the movie theater bathroom was one of the worst moments of my life. I've overdosed on cocaine and opiates before, I've had severe alcohol poisoning, hell, I have had several bad trips before on both LSD and psilocybin but nothing compared to this. What I felt on those psychedelic bad trips was fear, yes, but it was more like awe and amazement to the point that made me nervous and blew my mind and my fears then were a result of my realization that I was just a teeny, little insignificant part of the universe. On an acid trip, I cried, but I also laughed and loved. Acid was scary at times but it was a good fear, the kind that makes you grow as a person. My bad weed trip, however, had no insight to offer whatsoever. There was no depth, no connectedness, no realizations, only primal, utter fear of the deepest kind that was disjointed and disharmonic. Like concentrated adrenaline and anxiety and confusion that was unrelenting, unceasing, and unyielding. I felt like a lost child in some evil and foreign place and that I would never see anyone or anything that I love ever again. Just pure fear.

After about 20 minutes in there which felt like a few more hours, my wife texted me asking if I was okay. She realized I hadn't come back and left the theater and was waiting for me on a bench outside of the bathroom. She offered to come in and help me but I didn't want to draw more attention to myself so I somehow managed to text her and say I need to just sit in here for a minute. She waited for me out there for about another 30 minutes before telling me she wanted to come get me so she could drive us home. At some point, I thought someone was banging on my stall's door and trying to get at me. Someone screaming at me to come out right fucking now. This very well could have been a hallucination of psychosis and not a real person. I don't know. It wasn't my wife, she waited outside for me as I sent her a garbled text that I'd be out in a minute.

My vision was still severely fucked up at this point and I couldn't see very well, so she took me by the arm and guided me out. I had to take the theater steps one at a time like a little old man because I was so unsteady on my feet. Somehow we made it to the car. I don't have any recollection of this journey. I remember walking out of the theater and then suddenly I'm in my car in the passenger seat. I cried a little bit more and I begged my wife not to drive yet because I was paranoid thinking the police were watching us and would drop spike strips to run us off the road. So we sat in the car for another 20 minutes before she said fuck it and drove us home, telling me I'd be more comfy if I was tripping out in bed instead of in public. I think I passed the peak somewhere on the drive home because my vision and hearing started to come back to me, and as soon as we got into the house I descended from paranoid mania into just being super fucking stoned. I fell asleep almost immediately in my bed and I was still ripped when I woke up for work the next day.

I was mentally fucked up for about two weeks after this experience. I felt semi-stoned for a solid 3 days and my memory was affected for the next 3 weeks. After a while, I tried to just laugh it off, and decided to try to smoke again. Well, it happened again, not nearly to the same degree but just enough to make me uncomfortable instead of fun-stoned. My mind just began to race and my anxieties really blew up. As soon as I took a puff, everything that had worried or troubled me that week immediately came to the front of my brain and it was all I could think about. I could no longer stand to be stoned around anyone other than my wife, as I felt they were all judging and laughing at me. So I just kinda stopped smoking. That was two years ago and every time since then that I've smoked, I'd had some degree of anxiety that made it unpleasant. I get so lost in my own head and very often spiral into a mild panic attack unless I'm at home with my wife and I can distract myself with a video game or something.

I do feel like this experience has permanently affected my brain as it relates to anxiety. Despite being in a better living situation today - better job, more money, more stability - than I was when this happened, I'm way more on edge most of the time. I live in fear of another panic attack like that, because THC seems to amplify all of my deepest fears, which is insane because for 90% of my life it had the complete opposite effect. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Anyone here gone from an enjoyer of cannabis to someone who lives in complete fear of it?",at my wits end

(Ex: not going outside your house for days but also declining any offers to go out?),Anxiety,1583044265.0,75,1325,"Hi. I‚Äôve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn‚Äôt spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn‚Äôt until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they‚Äôre retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn‚Äôt relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had ‚Äúother groups‚Äù of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they‚Äôd be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I‚Äôm an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I‚Äôll be home for 3-4 days straight, can‚Äôt bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple ‚Äúsocialization for the day.‚Äù I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can‚Äôt bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on with me, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve reached such a level of being a slob that I can‚Äôt bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won‚Äôt get back (though let‚Äôs be real, I won‚Äôt be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

1ikj9v0,"22, lonely, sad",Anxiety,1739005517.0,1,2,"Hello, I'm a 22 year old male, almost 23. I am going through a rough time. I am very intellectual, charismatic, and gifted in a lot of areas of my life, but going through a tumultuous time in this area of my 20's.  
I'm a pilot, mechanic, and savvy in a lot of other areas. I have a great job. I am very well known at work, and feel like I make an impact there.

I went through high school as an outcast, though I was charismatic enough to have lots of girlfriends up until recently. I have always been gifted through different means whether it was through making money or excelling in different areas. Although I have always been rather strange socially, I am exuberantly confident, and charming to most people.

I am very young, but I have had tremendous life experience at my age. I cannot say much, but I have already held many different jobs, without a college degree, in the aerospace industry, and have managed to consistently make $120,000 through my current employer full time (for the past 2 years) and by most standard would be considered pretty successful. I have a nice car, I am cleaned up, I dress well, I am groomed, and yes, I am relatively good looking by most standards, some would say handsome.

I'm having an interesting time. I don't match on dating apps. I dated the same girl for 4 years from 16-20. We ended things when I moved across the US for work in 2022. Recently, for the past year I have been working 7 days a week, 10 hours a day, and making a lot of money. For the most part, my life is ""figured out"". I have an extremely intellectual job, and quite frankly build really cool shit. I am compensated handsomely.

The problem is: I don't have any friends. Not a single one. And no prospects of a future wife. Oh pity me. This may sound like, who cares? Theres an emptiness inside me that I cant explain. No real connection. After dating the same girl seriously for 4 years, and now having no contact with her (shes moving on to other guys and has become a frequent bar hopper), I have found myself in a situation.

Am I doing anything to try to improve my situation? I frequently go out to bars, by myself, and try to build connections. Sometimes even with coworkers. I feel like I am looked at as a freak, through my confidence and inventive opening lines, nothing gets through, and any numbers I do manage to collect don't lead to anything.

I feel like I am going down a black hole, and most nights are spent by my lonesome. The only social interactions I get are at work, which are a lot and good and healthy, but what's missing in my life is clearly the feminine comfort and girlfriend experience. What have I done to not deserve it at this point? I'm not sure. Maybe it's not my time, maybe it'll come later, I don't know. I've had many girlfriends, some for 2 months and some for years, but that one girl I dated for 4 years I just can't seem to get over, and having had no contact with her for almost 2 years at this point it's eating a hole inside me, and that coupled with being lonely and not having a different feminine distraction is awful.

I don't know what I'm getting at. I'm writing this half vodka-induced after getting off work, and sad. I'm young, the world is at my fingertips, I've worked really hard, yet I feel like I have nothing. I need a sweet girl who's serious and looking to build a future.

Any advice is appreciated. I'm torn. :(",lonely

I wanted to share something that happened yesterday. I've been dealing with anxiety for years, but I've always managed to keep it under wraps at work. Yesterday, during a team meeting, I felt it building up the rapid heartbeat, the dizziness, the overwhelming urge to flee.

Before I knew it, I was hyperventilating in front of everyone. I was mortified. I thought, ""Great, now everyone knows I'm a mess.""

But then something unexpected happened. My boss calmly ended the meeting and sat down next to me. She didn't bombard me with questions or make a scene. She just said, ""It's okay. Let's take a walk.""

We went outside, and she shared that her sister also struggles with anxiety. She told me to take the rest of the day off and offered resources our company provides for mental health.

I always thought showing vulnerability at work was a weakness, but her kindness showed me otherwise. If you're struggling, please know that there are people who will understand.

n0y195,My Uber driver had a panic attack mid-ride. Here's what happened.,Anxiety,1619676000.0,153,5969,"It was early afternoon and I had summoned an Uber driver from my home to take me to a friends house to watch some basketball about 25-30 minutes away.

He arrives, greetings were fine, asked me how my day was, standard stuff. Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well!

&#x200B;

About 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: ""Sorry I have to pull over."" I reply: ""Ok is everything alright?."" He says ""Sorry having a panic attack.""

I remained calm and told him, ""Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.""

Luckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.

He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: ""I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.""

&#x200B;

About 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways. I think fresh air and giving him space helped him instead of worrying about finishing his trip with me. Anyways just a small story I had today. Cheers",panic attacks

1jqrdak,"sleep anxiety, insomnia, depression, addiction, i don‚Äôt know anymore",Anxiety,1743707695.0,1,2,"to preface this is gonna be long as hell (think essay) and probably nonsensical since i still feel delirious from last night, so feel free not to read. i just am trying to get everything out there and hope maybe one of you kind strangers out there can give me some advice because i feel like nobody gets it, but maybe one of you might?

when it comes to sleep, i‚Äôm not the best at it, but i‚Äôve been okay for a while. until recently (last weekend) a bout of insomnia set me off. if i‚Äôm able to get to sleep, it‚Äôs usually fine. on days where it‚Äôs fine and i go to sleep, i still wake up multiple times at night to use the restroom, but i‚Äôm usually calm enough to just go back to bed after knowing i did sleep in the first place. thing is, i also sleep until like 11am every day and even then i don‚Äôt feel rested. i have a very overactive bladder in general, even if i barely drink any water at night. on nights where i can‚Äôt sleep, the anxiety kicks into overdrive and i find myself getting up to use the bathroom every 10 minutes, it feels like there‚Äôs pressure on my bladder constantly even if i pee very little and i won‚Äôt be able to sleep unless it‚Äôs empty. and the cycle begins. i feel like i put so much pressure on myself to get sleepy i just end up crying all night feeling like a crazy person begging god even thought i‚Äôm not even very religious or anything just to be able to sleep. but i‚Äôve been fine, and on nights where i do sleep, i‚Äôm usually okay, even if i wake up multiple times. but last week, when i woke up in the early morning and couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep, my anxiety for some reason kicked into overdrive when my thoughts wouldn‚Äôt stfu.

i don‚Äôt like looking at the time anymore as it just gives me anxiety thinking about how many hours until i once again have to try to attempt sleep and whether or not it will be successful. i don‚Äôt even like seeing the time stamp on a youtube video because it just reminds me of how many minutes have passed by of me not sleeping. so trying to watch videos to bed can be relaxing sometimes and has been, but recently seeing the time stamps and the noise being too loud and the lights being too bright just sets me off. i never fall asleep to the videos in general, i always end up turning it off at some point because i hate the glare on my eyelids. i know another suggestion to get tired is reading but i don‚Äôt read really, i feel like i wouldn‚Äôt even be able to focus enough to read a book without my thoughts getting the better of me. there‚Äôs always that worry in the back of my head no matter what i distract myself with. i‚Äôve convinced myself that certain patterns i see around me will dictate whether i will sleep or not, if that makes any sense? i don‚Äôt want to explain the patterns because i feel like if i do, it‚Äôs like jinxing them and it won‚Äôt work anymore‚Ä¶yeah, not sure what that‚Äôs about. when i try deep breathing it usually doesn‚Äôt help and at some point i end up hyperventilating and sobbing uncontrollably. i wake my bf to try to soothe me by giving me back rubs and massages and that helps temporarily but then he falls asleep again and i cycle back because i have no one there with me. i also legit can‚Äôt sleep without knowing he‚Äôs there with me, when i‚Äôm at my house, we facetime to bed. i know i shouldn‚Äôt be putting that on him, he has a full-time job and has to wake up in the morning, and i act selfishly. i try to think about comforting things but it just cycles back, that i‚Äôm thinking about these things in order to go to sleep and genuinely my brain feels like torture. like i wish i just had an off switch for my brain. i tell myself i just want to die over and over again and i wish i could just die, because me ACTUALLY killing myself is not an option. i‚Äôm not the type of person that can function on no sleep, even though i know nothing is going to happen to me. i just don‚Äôt want to deal with feeling like shit, my anxiety regarding the side effects and the sleepiness will send me sobbing and jittery the entire day thinking about whether i‚Äôll be able to sleep the next night, and the next night. i work at a small family business and i haven‚Äôt been going lately and i feel so guilty.

i take supplements/herbal teas/syrups meant for calming and sleepiness, sometimes i feel like it helps but i fear it‚Äôs just placebo. i try getting some exercise in during the day, again, maybe it works sometimes but most of the time i worry it‚Äôs just placebo. it doesn‚Äôt help the anxiety, i can‚Äôt get out of that anxious headspace UNLESS i take a 2mg bar of xanax (non-prescribed, i know). that is always my last resort as i‚Äôm petrified of getting addicted to that stuff and i hate how i feel the next day. but the fact that it‚Äôs able to sedate me and put me to sleep in those moments of panic, it‚Äôs like my ONLY lifeline and i feel like i genuinely need it in times when nothing works but god i hate how it feels after. i feel so guilty for even taking it in the first place. and i‚Äôm running out, and have no way of getting anymore at the moment. i feel like an addict (more on that later).

i went to the dr recently. my regular dr wasn‚Äôt there (he never is tbh) so i went through walk-in. i‚Äôve tried asking for psychiatrist/psychologist a year ago but was denied. didn‚Äôt get anything out of that. he saw my file and i told him what‚Äôs going on, the lack of sleep and anxiety surrounding it and he prescribed me lexapro (escitalopram). said to take 10mg every morning (1 pill) then 20mg (2 pills) after 1 week. i‚Äôm starting to worry about even doing that in the first place, 10-20 seems like a big jump from what i‚Äôm reading, usually people go from 5-10. he barely even said any side effects except nausea and headache, but i‚Äôm reading it can get A LOT worse than that. i‚Äôm thinking about starting in may, and i‚Äôll touch on that more, but now i‚Äôm not so sure anymore. i have a couple of friends on it they say it‚Äôs fine, but here i‚Äôm reading for the first couple weeks it will only bring more anxiety and insomnia. i‚Äôm petrified of that because if i don‚Äôt sleep, i genuinely tweak the hell out. i don‚Äôt know HOW to deal with insomnia, i don‚Äôt know how not to worry about it. i do want to start to take it because i hear in the long run it does help a lot of people, but april is a month chalked full of events for me (birthdays, my birthday, getaways with friends) and i really want to do all of those things and if i have to deal with elevated anxiety and no sleep i just know i won‚Äôt be able to, and i will feel horrible about it because these are genuinely things i look forward to. fomo is severe for me. my bf doing these things without me would ruin me, i just know. i definitely have some attachment issues‚Ä¶

a little on depression, doc said i seem to be depressed as well, because if my lack of motivation. when i mentioned i feel like an addict, well i sort of am? didn‚Äôt tell him that because i‚Äôm ashamed. when i go out drinking on the weekends (as most 20 something year olds do) i‚Äôm always last one awake, drinking myself to sleep. the bigger concern for me though, is i‚Äôve been smoking weed daily for about 3 years now and just this week i‚Äôve decided i‚Äôm going to quit because i know for a fact it‚Äôs brought on more anxiety and lack of motivation to do anything but sit all day and play video games. i feel like such a degenerate and waste. i decided if i am to start taking this medication, i‚Äôm going to quit smoking, hence why i wanted to start in may and flush myself of that shit. i heard withdrawals from weed can cause insomnia as well and it‚Äôs been about 5 days now, i slept fine the first couple days since my last anxious night and i thought i was ok until last night the small things like time, tv too loud and bright, my bf shifting in his sleep, it being hot in the room, me potentially having to work today (already told my boss/mom i won‚Äôt be coming in) set me off and i just lost it. took a xanax last night around 3-4 am and it did knock me out but god i feel like shit today. i feel like this is a never-ending curse. i‚Äôm supposed to work tomorrow but i know i won‚Äôt be going, just the thought of it is making me feel so guilty and worthless. 

my family has a long history of mental illness that just has always gone unaddressed. my dad is medicated but i don‚Äôt really ever see him, he kind of just lives his own life. my mom‚Äôs definitely got some problems with outbursts (as do i) and doesn‚Äôt believe in medication and thinks drs and pills are just going to mess me up more, tells me to just drink tea and not think, as if it‚Äôs so easy esp with my constant peeing. she keeps asking me why do i feel this way, i have nothing to be stressed about, and can i even imagine how she feels when i tell her i can‚Äôt sleep and i can‚Äôt work. she has nights where she can‚Äôt sleep very well either but she still is able to get up and go to work. work isn‚Äôt even that crazy, it‚Äôs customer service though and GOD am i terrible when it comes to people, social anxiety is definitely a bitch, every interaction is nerve-racking. i just think to myself why can‚Äôt i do the same? why can‚Äôt i just be fucking normal? i‚Äôve been staying at my bf‚Äôs house because i just don‚Äôt want to go back home and be alone and face my family‚Äôs concerns and disappointment, asking me ‚Äúyou were fine, what happened?‚Äù like as if i‚Äôm supposed to know? 

i feel so fucked up guys. i don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. i‚Äôm just sitting here worrying about tonight again, and i most definitely am not taking another xanax. in those moments of panic i feel like it‚Äôs my only escape but i fucking HATE it genuinely. i woke up a little after 12pm and have just been bedrotting under the sheets in a dark room and have no intention on getting up and doing anything because i feel like my head spinning still. i just want it all to go away. and it‚Äôs really hard to accept the fact that this is something i have to live with when only a few years ago, i used to be fine. even as little as a year ago, sleep wasn‚Äôt so much of a concern for me as it is now. last year during a traumatic vacation where i barely slept at all because of someone snoring, me being in a different country from my bf, and a horrific plane ride had me hallucinating weird patterns and shit by the time i got back home from lack of sleep and that really traumatized me i think? and since then, i‚Äôve never been able to shake the fear surrounding it. therapy is too expensive and honestly i did it online once with a student and was paying less, and i feel like it got nowhere, and eventually prices went up and i just ghosted. i just wasn‚Äôt able to open up, but this was long before the persistent sleeping issues arose. maybe i should try again, i‚Äôm sure i would be financially supported by my mom but i don‚Äôt want to put that on her anymore. i also don‚Äôt know where to find a therapist that can properly help me deal with this shit.

i guess i just wanted to know if anyone out there goes through something similar and how they deal with it? should i consider taking the medication sooner or stick it out till may? do i take the 10 like the dr recommended or go to 5? i‚Äôm a 22 year old female btw. i finished school but now feel directionless. i‚Äôm a creative person, but have been lacking the desire to create for so long. i just want to be myself again, and live a fulfilling life.

What‚Äôs holding me back from making any big decisions is the thought of wasting the year and a half I‚Äôve already spent here. I‚Äôm scared of starting over, but I‚Äôm also scared of continuing something that doesn‚Äôt make me happy. It feels like I‚Äôm stuck, and I don‚Äôt know what to do.  

I know my situation might not seem like much compared to what other students are going through. I‚Äôm aware that some have it much harder than I do, and I really admire their strength. But for me, this feels like a huge challenge, and I‚Äôm struggling to handle it.  

If anyone has gone through something similar, I‚Äôd really appreciate your advice or words of encouragement. I feel lost, and I just want to make the right decision without regretting it later on. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

1hijjcl,"22M - Struggling with Burnout, Derealization, and Weird Symptoms. Is This Even Possible at My Age?",Anxiety,1734700492.0,0,2,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my story and see if anyone here has gone through something similar. I‚Äôm a 22-year-old guy, and over the past few years, I‚Äôve been grinding hard. About three years ago, I started a few companies and have been working 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM almost every day since. I‚Äôve always thought I was taking good care of myself‚Äîworking out, sleeping well, and eating clean.

# The Build-Up

Around 2 years ago, I started feeling like work wasn‚Äôt as fun anymore. My business partner began pushing me hard‚Äîcalling me out every time I messed something up‚Äîand it really started to take a toll. Fast forward to August 2023, I packed my life into two bags and traveled around Europe for a month. During that time, I started sleeping less and drinking more, though I kept up with my workouts.

After that trip, I planned to go to Cape Town. At the airport, I had two glasses of wine and suddenly felt extremely dizzy. While waiting at the gate, I couldn‚Äôt breathe and had what I think was my first-ever panic attack. It was terrifying, but it passed after a couple of hours on the plane.

# Where Things Went Downhill

When I arrived, I felt okay for a day. But the next morning, I had coffee, and¬†*boom*‚Äîderealization hit me like a truck. I felt completely disconnected from myself, and it hasn‚Äôt gone away since. I stayed in bed for three days, panicking, before flying home.

Since then, I‚Äôve been dealing with these symptoms on and off:

* **Headaches**: Mostly in the neck and front of my head (come and go).
* **Derealization/Depersonalization**: Constant, 24/7.
* **Fatigue**: I feel drained all the time.
* **Tinnitus**: This started about two months ago.
* **Sleep**: I sleep one extra hour per night now but still feel tired.
* **No motivation for work**: I used to love working, but now I can‚Äôt find the drive.
* **Weak hands**: My grip feels weak at times, but it‚Äôs fine when I work out.
* **Blurry/busy vision**: It happens occasionally.
* **Health anxiety**: Constantly worrying about what‚Äôs wrong with me.

I have always been a guy who have found ""Cure"" in things.

If I'm tired, I workout more, sleep better and eat better food.

If I was stressed I went to the forest.

If I wanted someone to love me I found a girl for a few months.

I've always found a solution for everything, even tho they haven't been good always.

**My Current Lifestyle**

**Right now, I‚Äôm trying to maintain a balanced lifestyle to support my recovery. I work out 4-5 times a week and eat clean foods, including fruits, while also taking supplements like creatine, zinc, and magnesium. I sleep until my body naturally wakes up and work around 6-8 hours a day.**

**However, I don‚Äôt hang out with friends much, which I know isn‚Äôt great for mental health, but I do have a girlfriend who‚Äôs been supportive. Living in Sweden, it‚Äôs dark and cold this time of year, so I haven‚Äôt been spending much time outside, which might also play a role in how I‚Äôm feeling.**

# Extra Context

For the past 2-3 years, I‚Äôve also had ongoing issues with one of my testicles. It‚Äôs been a hard time dealing with this, and I think it‚Äôs added to my stress. I‚Äôve booked my 10th appointment to figure it out because I want answers.

I also booked an appointment to check if I really have asthma since I don‚Äôt want to use my asthma medication anymore unless I truly need it.

# What I‚Äôm Wondering

* Do I need to resolve these other issues (like my testicle problems or asthma concerns) before I can fully recover from what I‚Äôm going through now?
* Is it even possible to burn out at 22?
* Has anyone else experienced derealization or similar symptoms from stress?
* What helped you recover?
* Should I stop booking appointments and just go about my life?

I think I‚Äôm doing this because I want to figure out what‚Äôs wrong with me. Any insights, experiences, or tips on recovery would mean the world to me.

Thanks in advance",burnout

Hi everyone. 
Mid December i decided to quit weed, a week later i decided to quit alcohol and caffeine too. I almost immediately noticed a loss of interest towards my hobbies. 

Ever since then it‚Äôs been a living hell. Up until February i was having bad panic attacks, i worked on those with a therapist and i‚Äôm now doing much better under that aspect. 

What hasn‚Äôt changed, and has worsened honestly, is the complete disinterest i have developed for all of my hobbies and life in general. The most i do is go to work, force myself to go work out, and sit on the couch with my gf, then go to sleep. 

I have lost all interest in editing photos, in taking photos, in posting them, in going to events where i can take them. I lost all interest in going out with my friends and acquaintances. I just feel so empty and unmotivated. I believed it was winter doing its thing, but the seasons are changing and my situation is mostly the same. I have even lost interest in sex. I am eating the same two foods for every meal. I don‚Äôt even find enjoyment in playing on my pc anymore, i bought myself a brand new pc for Christmas and have used it a few hours at most. I spent more time setting it up and building it vs the time i actually used it. 

I am getting tired of living like this, but i just feel so unmotivated to do anything, i lost all my drive and i‚Äôm just waiting to be better, waiting for the physical pains to go away, waiting for my mind to stop being so on edge. 

I miss my old self and have no idea how to get it back. I miss driving for hours to go to events and take photos there, i miss the late nights with friends, i miss being able to just go to a restaurant on my own and enjoy myself, i miss going out with my girlfriend and living our lives. I miss the person i was a few months ago, i feel like i‚Äôm just a shell of my old self, as if i‚Äôm running on power saving mode. And it only makes everything worse. 

Please share some advice if you can. I don‚Äôt know where i‚Äôm headed. 

Edit to add: I quit in order to become healthier, not because i had problems regulating myself. I'd smoke weed in the evening before bed (3/4 puffs) and on sunday morning (a bit more). As for alcohol, i was drinking to the point of being drunk once per month, tipsy twice per month. With the occasional beer here and there.

I would say my default setting is sort of a constant low level of anxiety with periods every few months of severe anxiety that can last a couple of weeks. I also struggle with OCD/intrusive thoughts which I‚Äôve learned to manage with CBT and medication, but when I have quite bad ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù(not sure what the right term is) this can be quite bad and scary. 

I notice that whenever I drink, my anxiety and intrusive thoughts are terrible for a couple of weeks and sometimes a hangover can kickstart the cycle. 

Over the years I‚Äôve learned my alcohol limits and been able to avoid getting into terrible states of anxiety due to alcohol. But the past couple of weeks I‚Äôve had a couple of occasions where I haven‚Äôt stuck to my limits (my hen do, 30th birthdays etc). It‚Äôs always been in the back of my mind whether I just quit drinking all together. My boyfriend is in AA and he claims that it might be more difficult to quit drinking when you don‚Äôt have a problem with abusing it. His mindset is he simply can not drink because he can‚Äôt do it in moderation and it will ruin his life etc. whereas I don‚Äôt have that because whilst it‚Äôs bad for my mental health I know I don‚Äôt have an issue with substance/alcohol abuse.

So a question, for those who have quit drinking for anxiety, has it helped and how have you changed your mindset to think ‚ÄúI cannot have a drink because of my mental health‚Äù. It seems like it would be tough to not fall back into ‚Äúwell one won‚Äôt hurt‚Äù. Also, how has your life changed for the better, and do you find social events more difficult/what is your response when people offer you a drink?

I never noticed it when I drank more heavily, but now it seems SO obvious - whenever I drink, even just two ciders over 3-4 hours, my anxiety the next day is through the roof. I wake up feeling like the world is ending, like every part of my life is going to fall apart someone and I‚Äôll be miserable forever.  It‚Äôs always worse first thing in the morning, but it lingers for days, even up to a week.

I made a previous master-post on my long-term anxiety symptoms (which I overcame) where I went over the more bizarre, rarely spoken about, constant symptoms of long-term anxiety, and the feedback loop and it seemed to help a lot of people. I will link that one below, I recommend everyone read it first!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10jcfko/longterm_anxiety_symptoms_i_had_from_someone_who/

A lot of you wanted to know how I overcame the DP/DR symptoms. I didn't realise that I had message requests on Reddit, and now I've got so many spanning across months ago that I can't find the time to get back to individually so I feel like its my duty to make this post and have it all in one place. Warning, this is a big post.

Lets go over some positives first as I find its always best to get off on a positive note, and to have something to look forward to or motivate others:

**1. DP/DR (Depersonalization and Derealization) is not and is never permenant, anyone who says so are catastrophizing and are probably biased or feeling that way due to their own condition not improving. These notions are not helpful and are also not true.**

**It will and can go away 100%, it is not something you have to 'deal' with or 'accept' for the rest of your life.**


**2. DP/DR does not work like a debt system e.g. the longer you are in DP/DR, the longer it is going to take you to get out of it (isn't true!). Everyone has the same chance of success in recovering from DP/DR, no matter how long or short you have been in that state.**
**3. DP/DR is not indicative or a sign of psychosis, and you will not become psychotic if you experience DP/DR.**


DP/DR is a **defense mechanism**, which attempts to make sure that only the body experiences pain or trauma and not the mind, by causing detachment. **Causes of DP/DR can be anxiety attacks, severe stress, health anxiety, drug induced (often from edibles or hallucinogens), traumatic first-hand or second-hand situations, abuse or any interpersonal trauma. Anyone of any age can experience DP/DR.**

.......................................................................

**What does DP/DR feel like?:**

- Everything feels (and looks) either too close or too far away from you, environments are distorted
- Everything feels flat or 2D, like it isn't quite real or tangible, others faces might feel unreal
- Can feel like the world is slipping away from you
- You might feel like you could fall over any second or fall through the floor
- Speech can feel slow/slurred, like your brain is struggling to find words
- Time can feel like its going too fast or too slow
- Feeling like you can observe yourself outside your body, everything feels disconnected, like you are very alone
- Your limbs can feel too small, too big, like you are taller or shorter than you actually are
- You might feel internally dizzy (like your mind is spinning but your vision isn't), woozy head feelings, fuzzy head
- More frequent feelings of nostalgia/dejavu
- Colours can feel more dull or distorted
- Feeling numb, like your memories are less tangible or unreal
- Hypochondria (Healthy Anxiety) is often a huge comorbidity with DP/DR

.......................................................................

**The Feedback Loop, what is it?**

Symptoms of DP/DR (as well as Anxiety/Health Anxiety) are often kept alive by or started something called the **Feedback Loop.** This is a loop that is constantly being fed into, which could have started from something as for example:

*You may be minding your own business one day and suddenly experience a Panic Attack, but you misread it as being something worse. You could think you're about to die, that you are having a heart attack because of the palpitations, that you could collapse any moment now, and then it goes... but you're on edge, what if it happens again? Do I have a heart condition? I think I'm dying, I think something is wrong. Everyday you are waking up and checking if you can feel palpitations, you're scared it will happen again, you're getting waves of dread, your mind is full of 'what ifs' over and over again every single day. Then one day, nothing feels real and you feel completely detached from reality and this scares you even more, you feel like you're slipping away, you're terrified and feel like you'll never be normal again. You're waking up everyday to check if everything still feels unreal, and it does, its not going away. Whats happening?*


This is the **Feedback Loop** example which led to DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms. What should've happened when you experienced for example: a Panic Attack, was that **you should've been able to realise it was a Panic Attack and been able to ground yourself or calm down during that situation and it would go away. This would eliminate the start of the Feedback Loop**, but instead by misreading the situation or not having the appropriate tools to manage it, you are now in fear, in high stress and feeling traumatised of the situation in fear it will happen again or that something worse is happening to you. This keeps the Loop alive and going.

**In preparation for the pain or fear you are about to anticipate happening, your body chose to disassociate from your mind and cause DP/DR in order to handle the stress and fear of what you're afraid of experiencing. DP/DR is attempting to save you from what could happen to you next, after being activated from something that already hurt you or traumatised you.**

Identifying the first source of your DP/DR can be particularly important in understanding and learning where your Feedback Loop started. **For some people it can even extend to as far as childhood, which can sometimes result in something known as DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)**. Once you have identified the source, this is the stepping stone into recovering from DP/DR.

Sources of DPDR can be: drug-induced from hallucinogens/edibles/bad trips/alcohol or other substances, anxiety attacks, depression, stress, medical trauma/childhood trauma/adulthood trauma/being a child of divorce, sexual assaults/CSA, PTSD, DID and more

Environments are also very important to be recognised as sources of DPDR e.g. stressful jobs, stressful/abusive relationships, difficult home life, being a full-time carer for family, difficult school life etc

.......................................................................

**So what's going to help me get better?**

There's a lot of resources and therapies available for DP/DR, such as Psychotherapy (talking therapies), CBT, DBT, EMDR and more.

But what is most important is that you are able to help yourself, as well as having professional support should you require it. **The thing that is going to get you better the most is you, and the tools you can develop to help you in time of need and in how you navigate the world and your trauma**. Some people (like me) may be able to recover from DP/DR without professional intervention or therapies, but it is always incredibly recommended if you have access or can afford it. **With DP/DR being highly trauma related, it is important to have a safe place to unload and traverse trauma with a professional**, as it can be tough to handle alone. **If you are concerned or suspect your DP/DR may be a result of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder), professional help is absolutely necessary.**

Every person with DP/DR will be completely unique in their needs, what they can handle alone or what they need support with.

.......................................................................

**What can we do for ourselves?**

This is going to go over some self-practices and tools you can do in your own time to help yourself while actively experiencing DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms, and also how to reduce the chances of re-experiencing it when you are recovered.

**Staying Busy & Challenging Yourself:**

A big part of dissolving the Feedback Loop is by no longer feeding into it, and one way of doing this is by diverting our thoughts from the feelings of DP/DR or anxiety symptoms. **You want to find or make opportunities where you don't have time to think about DP/DR, or how it makes you feel, 'scanning' for feelings or signs of it, and to challenge those feelings instead.**
**DP/DR and anxiety is the perfect time to get busy and involved with life**, whether it is your hobbies, being with your friends and family, doing chores that need to be done, starting things you've always wanted to do. **It can feel scary, even terrifying to partake in these things when you feel unreal, like you're not present or that the world is slipping away, but you must keep pushing through**. Once you begin to challenge yourself and challenge those feelings of 'not feeling real' you begin to establish trust within yourself.

**Don't be disheartened that DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms do not disappear right away overnight, this is because your body hormonally, needs time to acclimate to low levels of stress and anxiety after having been kept at such high levels. If these hormones were to plummet immediately, the body wouldn't be able to cope, so it likes to decline it gently! So consider it like you are establishing trust:**

DP/DR has been in the drivers seat all this time, and you've been the passenger in the back. You're finally insisting on being in the driver's seat, but DP/DR insists on being the passenger right next to you. DP/DR is going to freak out in the passenger seat and take the wheel from you at times during some tough situations because its not sure you can navigate it on your own, and instead of letting it take the driver's seat again you need to say to it, 'Don't worry. I've got this'. and DP/DR will let go of the wheel. This in real life, would be an example of you handling the situation you are in and challenging yourself to face what makes you afraid (such as going outside in case you feel 'unreal').

**By doing this, you are establishing trust and are giving DP/DR the opportunity to know that you can handle the situation on your own. Eventually with time of practicing these things, DP/DR will get out of the car entirely and you can 'drive' all by yourself again and those feelings of DP/DR will be gone. You'll be able to live your life without things like anxiety or DP/DR dictacting where it takes you or how it makes you feel. You will have formed that trust that you can handle experiencing your pain, your fear, your trauma, your anxiety/stress etc. without the need of the defence mechanism of DP/DR. You will become the first line of defence!**

From personal experience this is what accelerated me to my complete recovery from DP/DR and long-term anxiety symptoms within 3-4 months of this practice after struggling for almost a year of non-stop DP/DR and anxiety symptoms. **I learned to empathise with my DP/DR's attempt at trying to keep me safe and acknowledged that it was only doing this in order to make me feel better, albeit in a scary and inconvenient way! So by learning techniques and also teaching myself not to be scared of DP/DR symptoms or my anxiety symptoms, I gave myself the opportunity to be the one in control and say ''Hey, I am totally capable of caring for myself now. Thank you for your help and what you tried to do for me'' to my DP/DR.**

By feeling afraid to participate in activities or doing things because you might feel unreal, or because the world feels distorted, you are allowing DP/DR to maintain control and are keeping DP/DR as an option

**Challenge yourself in incriments or in steps, and remember to reward yourself afterwards. Figure out what about DP/DR makes you afraid:**

**is it seeing people's faces? particularly friends or family?** - challenge yourself towards looking at faces, engaging with familiar faces (YouTubers, family, partners), if you can touch their face then touch it, grounding exercises where you say ''I can see two eyes, they are [insert colour], they have a [description] nose, do they have freckles? birth marks? do they have any smile lines? identify parts of their face and describe them'' this helps make them more tangible and less scary. Do little challenges before the bigger ones.

**is it going outside in case you feel unreal? woozy?** - challenge yourself towards small, short walks up and down your street, to eventually longer walks, acknowledge that you might be feeling dizzy/unreal but that you are safe, be kind & go home if you need it, try again another day, stay engaged with your hobbies/the outside world

**is it the feeling that you'll never be the same again? that you think its permenant? that you've ruined your life?** - The first thing you'll see if you look up 'can dpdr be permenant' is 'no!' and every other article will say no. There has never been an observed case of DPDR being permenant, and you won't be the first case of that happening. Its really important you do not entertain or engage with people who believe it is permenant, or that theirs is permenant because they are just people who are keeping their own DPDR alive with the negativity. I recommend writing positive affirmations or reading them, and engaging with positive stories of DPDR recovery and sticking with facts. **You have not ruined your life, and you will recover.**
**DPDR can make you feel afraid of lots of things, not just the ones I described above (but those are the most common).**

**Grounding Exercises:**
Grounding is a way to refocus and bring your attention back to the present and the world around you. This is can be used when experiencing fear or anxiety of your current DP/DR state, but is **most effective when you feel like it is 'coming on' or you are experiencing anxiety/stress that could lead to it.**

Grounding exercises can involve:

- Naming 5 things you can see, name 4 things you can touch and to touch them, naming 3 things you can hear and listening to them, what 2 things can you smell, 1 thing you can taste.
- Holding ice cubes, putting your hands in cold water, picking up or touching things and explaining how it feels (is it cold, warm, does it feel rough or soft), identifying their colours deeply
- Walks without music, tuning into the sounds of your steps, counting your steps, observing your surroundings on your walks, sitting in the grass and touching it.
- Mental anchoring by saying (in your head or quietly to yourself) your full name, your age, where you live, what street you live on, the date, where you are, what you're doing. Repeat this gently until you feel calm.
- Self-assurance phrases such as, ''You are okay'', ''Nothing can hurt me'', ''You will get through this'', ''I've done this once and I can do it again'' etc.

.......................................................................

**My Example of How I Personally Recovered from DPDR:**

For me I dealt with a lot of wooziness/dizziness during my DP/DR and I felt terrified to do anything sitting up or standing because I'd have to acknowledge that dizzy feeling and the unreal-ness from DP/DR, so I would lie on my side all day while watching TV or playing games instead to cope. **I wanted to turn 'Oh god, no I'm dizzy and woozy and nothing feels real, I'm so scared' into 'Oh I'm dizzy and feel unreal today? Lets see what I can manage'.**

It started to become more of 'Let's get up! Lets engage with the same hobbies but lets sit up this time'. I'd do that for as long as I feel I could handle the dizzines and unreal sensations, and then I'd lie back down again. I rewarded myself and cared for myself with a technique that brought me comfort, while having succeeded in engaging with something that scared me or was difficult. Over time I'd start to sit up for longer, or I'd start to go outside on short walks (which was particularly hard as I'd feel more unreal outside than at home), and I would feel unreal, like everything was flat, like the world was slipping away but I did it.

Some days I would just cry or feel like I took steps back, that I'd be stuck forever but I kept going and I kept rewarding myself after those times with either little lie downs, eating things I really loved, engaging in self-care or watching familiar TV shows I know I loved. Over time I started to sit up a lot more, I started to stand more, I started to go out more and for much, much longer each time, I started to do all the things I loved again despite how I felt. **Don't get me wrong, I still felt unreal and dizzy but I wanted to stop being scared of it and to not let it stop me engaging with things I loved or wanted to do.**

**I stopped basing my days and thoughts on 'how good I'm feeling' and more so on 'how well can I manage today'.** That took away a lot of pressure for me, as I knew I would not feel better over night but I would learn to manage my days better, so focusing on that intrinsically helped me feel better. You'll want to learn how to manage bad days (whether DPDR days, anxious days, stressful days) because when you do, you'll become prepared for if you ever face any of those times again and you can conquer it!

One day after months of challenging myself, being more present, doing my hobbies, going outside (I remember this vividly) I was hugging my partner and I looked up at his face and I physically jumped, **he looked real. I started looking around everywhere and everything felt real, everything looked so colorful, the world didn't feel flat or distorted, everything felt 'real' and 'right' and when I touched my partner's face it felt so tangible and real.** I don't think I've ever cried that hard in my life from happiness, my DPDR was gone.

Everything probably felt like this for a while, but because I was so engrossed in engaging with the world around me and doing the things I loved I didn't actually realise it, because I was no longer questioning my reality or looking for signs of DP/DR. **So that one moment where I finally remembered to 'check' my reality, it made me realise everything felt real again and that I felt human again. And it never came back.**

When you feel ready, the key is to be kind to yourself as well as challenge yourself against your DPDR and how it makes you feel. By pushing through and engaging with the world around you bit by bit you will start to establish that trust, those tools, in convincing your body that you can handle yourself and that it no longer needs to detach with DPDR to keep you safe.

.......................................................................

**Some habits to get into, and some to get rid of:**

- **Cut out all alcohol and all drugs absolutely and completely, as well as caffeine & reduce or quit smoking.** All of these substances will have an effect on the hormones in your body, and can impede progress from DP/DR due to the sensations it can produce and will generally stress out the body, and mind-altering drugs like hallucinogens or Cannabis can worsen DP/DR greatly or keep it around. *If you are an addict or suffer from addictions, get in touch with services that can help you taper, detox or navigate potential sobriety, do not attempt any of this alone.*

- **Establish a normal bedtime routine**, ideally getting into bed at 9-10pm and waking up before 9am. Some people need more sleep than others so wake up at whatever time in the morning before 9am is best for you; getting adequate sleep will greatly improve the rate of which your DP/DR can dissolve as your mind will be most lucid, alert and prepared to handle potential stressors. **Sleeping too much or too little can greatly affect your brain and hormone regulation, and you need the best hormone regulation in order for the body to lower cortisol levels which leads to DP/DR symptoms rapidly improving.**

- **Stay hydrated and well-fed.** This is really typical mental health advice, but in general you will want to make sure you are hydrated and well-fed so the body has enough energy supply to handle stressors, anxiety and to ensure the mind is as lucid and energised as possible. You will need all the energy you can possibly get, and having these bases covered can really improve your symptoms.

- **Get checked for any Vitamin Deficiencies** as a lot of Vitamins we can be deficient in will greatly effect circadian rhythms, heart rhythms, the brain (deficiencies can cause brain fog, low motor skill function and poor hormone regulation). **Making sure we have healthy, functioning foundations to work off of greatly supports mental function and our ability to take on new information and learn new things (such as therapeutic tools and treatment).**

- **Identify your stressors and reduce them, identify your triggers and navigate them.** Cortisol levels increase with stress (from stressors) and anxiety, when we are faced with high levels of cortisol for extended periods of time, the body can produce bizzare and scary symptoms (which are harmless).

1bq7v6m,Anxiety & Substance Abuse,Anxiety,1711662808.0,1,2,"Hi,

So my story, I'm 40, I've had anxiety since about 17 years of age. 

I've used drink and cocaine most of my adulthood. 

I got 100 days sober last year before falling of the wagon again, it used to be recreational use but in recent years it was becoming a daily thing, morning noon and night. I wake up to a line of coke. 

I'm almost 4 weeks clean again now but they were 4 of longest weeks ever anxiety wise. 

It seems it doesn't matter how long I go sober I still have crippling anxiety which leads me back to using again as I think what's the point. 

Even when I was 100 days clean I still wasn't at the place I thought I'd be at. (Although I was happy enough) but bored at the same time. I'd spend a lot of time doing things on my own, like golf, shopping, music etc.  

Cocaine is rife around my area and it's hard to get away from. 

I booked a holiday months ago for a friend's birthday and it's coming up soon. I know deep inside there's no way I will stay sober if I go and be back to square one. 

I suffer badly with agoraphobia, I'd love for once to be able to go away and be at peace with myself and not need to run to my emergency beer to calm me down, which leads to other bad things. ",substance abuse
1b7hp6l,I just had a panic attack in front of my substance abuse therapist and one of my group members.,Anxiety,1709675359.0,0,1,"They were really supportive.  I've had like 2-3 very mild ones around them before (been with them almost two years), and those were so mild I didn't even feel the need to point them out at the time.  The one I just had though...  Phew.  It's the worst panic attack I've had yet this year.  I was in the car and I think there might have been two group members in the car or none.  I know the therapist was there, though...  Because she was driving.  I have been chatty today, then suddenly just stopped talking, she said my eyes got kind of big, and she said I got my breathing under control almost immediately.  But it lasted a few minutes still, and for another two minutes or so it kept getting stronger and very disorienting.  I didn't tell her until about a minute before it ended.  She said I did a good job not panic-panicking like I used to.  And the fact that I can remember her saying that is a big deal.

I think one guy was in the car because we were driving down the road we only go down to pick him up/drop him off.  I think it happened around the time we got there.

My biggest complaint I've ever had about my panic attacks is that it fucks with my memory hardcore.  It is fucking insane.  I went from being on the Dean's List to failing out after two extra years and a few dozen panic attacks a day.  I can't remember anything beyond big events.  I can't remember details, and as a detail-oriented person, it drives me crazy and it is a little scary too.

I just want someone to commiserate with.  I feel so lonely.  I see my group once a week.  We are a dual diagnosis substance abuse group.  I'm the only woman in the group aside from the therapist leading it.  I kind of enjoy that though, because I get picked up first and dropped off last because she doesn't want them to know where I live.  Just in case!  Lol  And I can't complain because I have no transportation and I get extra time to vent to our therapist if I need to.  All of the guys hang out together outside of the group, but my therapist has told them to never try to ask for numbers from any females in the group.  I can understand and appreciate that.  But that's the only socializing I get most weeks.  Even counting online interactions (or lack thereof).  I am kind of hoping that someone who can relate, or even just someone who needs a friend, will reply.  Feel free to PM me if you prefer.

Thank you for reading.  I really needed to vent.  <3",substance abuse
1gcv7xv,"Tested 82 iq, can‚Äôt trust my own judgment properly anymore ",Anxiety,1729977645.0,149,285,"Years ago when I was 15, I got psychologically evaluated. My iq was a bit difficult to determine due to how dysfunctionally depressed I was. (GAD/MDD/PTSD/ADHD/Substance Abuse diagnosed) It was around the 70s‚Äô, however she estimated around 82 iq overall. 

In my junior year I was the only kid that didn‚Äôt finish the ACT on time. Even with an extension from my 504 plan. 

Weeks ago I was curious about my iq again, thinking maybe the test was wrong cause I was a kid with several untreated mental problems. Im currently on meds, and in therapy. Also off most drugs but weed and nicotine. I took an iq test online‚Äî look I‚Äôm aware people say those aren‚Äôt the most accurate. Plus my drug use at a young age‚Ä¶But I didn‚Äôt expect to get exactly 82 iq again. Maybe atleast average. That triggered my anxiety even on meds. I don‚Äôt have money to actually retake a professional test, but now I can‚Äôt stop ruminating over it. I always suffered through poor self esteem and a massive inferiority complex, with a dash of dependence and reliance on other people. I had little trust in my own judgement to begin with, but now it‚Äôs completely gone. I can‚Äôt handle such uncertainty like that. 

What if every opinion and any word out of my mouth is just‚Ä¶wrong? Every perspective, consideration, or reasoning I come up with feels like it‚Äôs poorly defined. I feel like theres more I should be knowing, or that I‚Äôm behind in understanding. I‚Äôve always been a helper, I love helping people with anyway I can but I‚Äôm too scared since my problem solving skills are insufficient, what if I make things worse? Also I‚Äôm a very slow person, someone can help faster and better. 

I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm just scared to do anything with my brain now. I have significant trauma of feeling like so little, and the iq is almost proving those feelings as true. Im so vocal about how stupid I feel, everyone in my real life disagrees. But they could be bias. 

I can‚Äôt exactly pinpoint why it bothers me so much, I just know that my capability to do things has been a sensitive topic for me for years. It‚Äôs clear IQ isn‚Äôt what makes a whole person. So It‚Äôs probably trauma and external opinions based. Idk. Advice is welcomed but I wanted to vent somewhere. My friends and family are probably sick of hearing about it from me. 

Anxiety did nothing but ruin my self image and become so self absorbed in the little things within myself. 

Edit: I‚Äôm seeing a lot of replies within a few minutes, kind of unexpected and overwhelming- I see lots of positive comments so ty. I hope this doesn‚Äôt come off as bad in anyway. I have history of ruminating over very insignificant things .. i think this stems even deeper than just the ‚Äúiq test‚Äù  

Edit 2: I just wanna say, sorry if I don‚Äôt reply back. Just know I likely have read your message and I greatly appreciate it. I think I‚Äôll keep this post up despite the anxiety, just so I can go back on it if I ever start to spiral.

Let's break the stigma and start with your new life TODAY! ,Anxiety,1729651309.0,82,250,"I understand there's a lot of stigma surrounding benzodiazepines, and I've mentioned this several times before. But here's the truth, some of us genuinely need them, just like others require insulin or beta blockers for conditions like high blood pressure.

If you're like me and have tried everything, therapy, supplements, lifestyle adjustments, for years and are still trapped in your room by debilitating anxiety, stop waiting. Seek out medication and start living your life right now, today!

Your time is now! You deserve to live in the moment.

Would you rather spend the next 20, 40, or more years bedridden just because most people are against medication?

It's strange, people accept smoking weed or drinking alcohol in excess, but the moment you take a benzo, it's considered wrong. That's unfair!

Like benzos, weed and alcohol have long-term effects. Everything does! Even the water you drink and the air you breathe contain harmful substances.

If you're constantly worrying about what will happen in 20 or 40 years, you may never truly enjoy your life.

In my family, my mom and several others have been on benzos and SSRIs for 40+ years, and they‚Äôre in their 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s now, completely healthy because they've never abused them.

If you need benzos every day to live a fulfilling life, go for it! Just be mindful not to misuse them.

If SSRIs are what you need, take them. Life is unpredictable, you might have a few years or several decades left, so why waste time feeling nauseous, overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts, and depressed, stuck at home?

You can live a normal life, get a job, or pursue an education. Do whatever it takes to feel better, without worrying about what others think, and focus solely on the present.

I hope everyone reading this feels better soon, just like I have since accepting that I need medication. I‚Äôm not concerned about side effects that may or may not show up in 30 or 40 years. I'll cross that bridge when I get there.

For now, I'm choosing to live my life fully, happy and functional, rather than spend decades in isolation, suffering, just because society stigmatizes medication.",substance abuse

I've tried EVERYTHING else imaginable: Hydroxizine, gabapentin, propanolol, Buspirone... the only thing that's worked before was Klonopin, and they absolutely won't prescribe it to me. It's getting so bad that I'm thinking about getting back on Oxy.

1ffo30n,Intense Brainstorming Feels Like Cocaine Without the High,Anxiety,1726208725.0,3,1,"Hey everyone,

I've recently encountered a weird phenomenon, and it's only the second time it's happened to me. I do business, so I often have brainstorming meetings where we discuss interesting stuff that really gets you thinking. Tons of ideas are thrown around, and it's super positive‚ÄîI really love these meetings. They usually last about three hours.

But here's the thing: after these meetings, I feel like I'm on cocaine‚Äîbut without the euphoria and with a big chunk of anxiety. I think about the brain like our body when exercising. If you just start running after sitting for five hours, your body isn't ready. You need to warm up first, and even after you stop running, your heart rate and temperature don't instantly go back to normal‚Äîit takes time to cool down.

I feel like that's what's happening to my brain. It starts accelerating, warming up, and then it's really hard for it to stop. It took me like three, four, or even five hours after the meeting to calm down. I understand what's happening‚Äîit's like a different state of consciousness, and I'm aware of it. I try to breathe, relax, and be mindful, but I just can't handle it. I can't focus; I have so many thoughts running through my head, and it causes anxiety to pop up and makes me feel really restless.

I'm just wondering if anyone has ever encountered something like this because it's new to me. It's only the second time it's happened. I usually have anxiety attacks, but they were caused by me smoking too much weed, which led me to think about death and have panic attacks. I worked on that with my psychologist and kind of beat it. Sometimes, if I eat bad food, it triggers my anxiety and fear of death, but that's different and more mild now.

This thing I'm describing is new and weird for me. I'll admit I did use some cocaine about a year ago for a period of two or three months‚Äînot frequently, maybe once every couple of weeks‚Äîand I haven't used it since. But I'm wondering if that might have had an effect on me because it feels like the pain of cocaine again but without the euphoria‚Äîit's just the same feeling.

I don‚Äôt know if this is related to my post but some context: I got addicted to cocaine and I was a heavy user for 3 years. I quit in 2019 and haven‚Äôt relapsed since.

In the past few years, since Covid / quitting coke, I have changed quite a lot. I feel like I‚Äôve completely regressed as a person. I always look forward to spending time with friends but when it comes to the day of seeing them, I get nervous and keep overthinking what they‚Äôll think of me. Sometimes I sweat. Sometimes I try to cancel on them. 

I get nervous when making basic conversation with people I don‚Äôt know. And when I talk to them I stutter or my voice breaks. I used to be able to chat to anyone, would happily make friends with random people or hit on girls. 

Also, I have some ‚Äúphysical‚Äù things that make me feel extremely self conscious and make me extremely uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt know if these would be considered anxiety. One is gonna sound gross/weird so apologies, but: I get worried that I have sh1t myself and other people can smell it. This is something I developed towards the end of my coke addiction. When I was high, I would get extremely paranoid of messing my pants and would spend hours on the toilet wiping my a$ repeatedly hundreds of times to check myself. 

The other paranoia from my addiction was seeing people watching me in the dark. Again, towards the end of my addiction, every time I got high, if it was dark outside and the curtains were open, i would see faces in the window watching me. If you aren‚Äôt aware, this is a common paranoia for coke addicts. 
I still feel very uncomfortable if there are dark windows. I don‚Äôt hallucinate but I get uncomfortable enough that I sweat and can‚Äôt focus.

The third physical sensation I get is if I am sitting next to someone with nothing in between us. Eg on a sofa. I get so uncomfortable, I can‚Äôt really explain it, but it really stresses me out and I get nervous and can‚Äôt focus. Idk if this is related to the first one.

Sorrry for the wall of text but does any of this sound like anxiety? I don‚Äôt know if these things are related or what caused them. But it has been getting worse over the last 4 years. Which coincides with when I quit drugs. I thought social anxiety is something you develop when you are a teenager. I don‚Äôt understand why I still get my coke paranoias when I have been clean for nearly 5 years.
I would like to try and get on top of these issues as I feel it is really affecting my life.
Thank you for reading and I appreciate any advice ‚ù§Ô∏è

1d5t89q,"A bad THC trip has left me with permanent anxiety; or, a warning for people with anxiety to not underestimate edibles",Anxiety,1717265945.0,237,342,"#Long post warning. TL;DR I had a nightmare edible trip a few years ago and it seems to have permanently affected the way I react to weed and increased my daily general anxiety. Looking for similar experiences, hoping for some explanation or a happy ending.


Title says it all. This incident happened about two years ago. Here's what I can remember from the trip:

Background: I smoked a lot on and off since I was in my late teens (now in my 30s). Had a brief period of hard drug use, then my wife helped me clean up my act and my life has been pretty sweet and my overall anxiety had been quite low - for the past few years, I haven't had anything stronger than a beer and some weed and generally that was fine until this incident happened. I never, ever in my life had any sort of weed-induced anxiety save for one time in high school when we got chased by the cops through a park while stoned, but an hour later we were just laughing about the experience. I do have general and social anxiety disorder but weed never amplified that, in fact it was always the opposite where weed would calm me down and mellow me out. It was like a miracle drug. I never got stuck in my own head or anything like that until this happened. This is important to note: for the months leading up to this incident, I stopped smoking daily to focus on work, usually only getting stoned on the weekends. So my tolerance had dropped.


Drove into the city to see a movie. Hanging around outside beforehand, I took two edibles 20 minutes apart, each of which contained roughly 2g of some dispensary shit that had been mailed in to our state. They were peanut butter firecrackers. I completely fucked up the dosage and accidentally put in about ten times as much as I intended (I'm bad at math). That was my first mistake. I did not take into account the fact that I had a lower tolerance and just wanted to get ripped. So I gobbled them down and the die was cast. Someone I talked to estimated that I ingested at least 800mg of TCH. For reference, I think the dosage of most edibles these days for normal people hover around 10mg.

About 35 min later, we were sitting in the theater when the first one kicked in almost all at once. For about 3 minutes, I was giggling and feeling good. Then I realized I was way more stoned than I expected, it was kicking in too fast, my heart was thumping, and the second one hadn't kicked in yet. So the anticipation of how much higher I was about to get started to make me uncomfortable. My only thought was the second one hasn't kicked in yet, it hasn't kicked in yet, holy shit this is going to be a lot. My hands began to tingle and I got lightheaded and all of a sudden my heartbeat and breathing seemed way too loud to be normal.

I tried to calm myself by telling myself that I was in a movie theater and all I had to do was sit and distract myself with the movie, and that was when the paranoia started. I felt like everyone behind us was watching me. I started breathing really quickly and I was just about to lean over and tell my wife when the second one kicked in.

Just like the first one, the second edible hit me in the head all at once like a hammer. I blasted off. For a moment, all I could do was grip the arm rests as tightly as I could and wheeze through my nose, trying to control my breathing. I started drooling and sort of foaming at the mouth like a dog. My vision exploded into a kaleidoscope of color but they weren't pleasant colors, they were hostile and unnatural alien ones that only served to reinforce the idea that I was not in a comfortable and natural place. I felt like a space monkey locked in some hateful alien zoo. The small rounded lights on the walkways seemed to me like eyes which were staring furiously at me. I lost the ability to hear things and all I could sense out of my ears was a low, deep evil droning like a ship's foghorn. I covered my ears but it didn't help so I started shaking my head furiously, whispering no, no, no. At this point my wife looked over at me to see wtf I was doing and she saw that I was tripping out. She whispered something to me but I couldn't hear her because I had lost my ability to hear or discern human words. Her voice made no sounds but her teeth scared the shit out of me. They looked like the angry teeth of a shark. She rubbed my hand and noticed I was sweating bullets.

This was the last point where I noticed anything about the movie. I sat in there for 20 or so more minutes but despite watching the screen I had no idea what was happening and I might as well been like the dude from Clockwork Orange who was brainwashed with his eyes taped open. Right after the second one kicked in, I got stuck in a mental thought loop where I could not perceive any conscious thought other than this is your last day on earth over and over again. I probably thought the phrase over a thousand times as I sat there. The Beatles song ""A Day in the Life"" played on loop in my mind, but not the nice part, the scary, dissonant crescendo part. The only words in my mind I could hear were YOU'RE DYING, YOU'RE DYING, YOU'RE DYING again and again.

I had just enough of my wits left in me to realize that I was about to puke so I got up as normally as I could, wobbling and jerking, and just pretended there was nobody else in the theater as I made my way for the exit. As I walked, my vision began to fail. Black spots dotted my scope of vision and things were morphing and shifting before me. I held the handrail as tightly as I could and completely lost my frontal vision as soon as I saw the bathroom. So, the last 20 or so feet I had to walk sideways like a crab using my peripheral vision as I could no longer see out of the front, only the sides. I noticed one of the popcorn minions was watching me carefully so I had to consciously act like I wasn't a drug addled lunatic because I was terrified they'd call the cops (at the time, we lived in a non legal state).

Made it to the bathroom just as the second edible peaked. I'd wager it was abound 1 to 1.5 hours after ingestion, although it felt more like 5 or 6. I stumbled into a stall and puked my guts out. I convinced myself my puke was full of blood and freaked out some more. Then I sat down on the toilet and tried to control my breathing, but every time I did I'd remember that my guts were bleeding and hyperventilate some more. I was distracted for a moment when I thought I saw a camera hidden in the stall lock and panicked some more because I thought the people in the theater were watching me on their phones through the camera in the bathroom. This sent me into a spiral so I sat on the toilet for a while burying my face in my hands and crying. At this point, I was wholly convinced of my imminent death. There was no peace with it at all, only pure, blind, primal panic. Nothing but adrenaline and the pounding of my own heart in my ears.

This period where I was alone in the movie theater bathroom was one of the worst moments of my life. I've overdosed on cocaine and opiates before, I've had severe alcohol poisoning, hell, I have had several bad trips before on both LSD and psilocybin but nothing compared to this. What I felt on those psychedelic bad trips was fear, yes, but it was more like awe and amazement to the point that made me nervous and blew my mind and my fears then were a result of my realization that I was just a teeny, little insignificant part of the universe. On an acid trip, I cried, but I also laughed and loved. Acid was scary at times but it was a good fear, the kind that makes you grow as a person. My bad weed trip, however, had no insight to offer whatsoever. There was no depth, no connectedness, no realizations, only primal, utter fear of the deepest kind that was disjointed and disharmonic. Like concentrated adrenaline and anxiety and confusion that was unrelenting, unceasing, and unyielding. I felt like a lost child in some evil and foreign place and that I would never see anyone or anything that I love ever again. Just pure fear.

After about 20 minutes in there which felt like a few more hours, my wife texted me asking if I was okay. She realized I hadn't come back and left the theater and was waiting for me on a bench outside of the bathroom. She offered to come in and help me but I didn't want to draw more attention to myself so I somehow managed to text her and say I need to just sit in here for a minute. She waited for me out there for about another 30 minutes before telling me she wanted to come get me so she could drive us home. At some point, I thought someone was banging on my stall's door and trying to get at me. Someone screaming at me to come out right fucking now. This very well could have been a hallucination of psychosis and not a real person. I don't know. It wasn't my wife, she waited outside for me as I sent her a garbled text that I'd be out in a minute.

My vision was still severely fucked up at this point and I couldn't see very well, so she took me by the arm and guided me out. I had to take the theater steps one at a time like a little old man because I was so unsteady on my feet. Somehow we made it to the car. I don't have any recollection of this journey. I remember walking out of the theater and then suddenly I'm in my car in the passenger seat. I cried a little bit more and I begged my wife not to drive yet because I was paranoid thinking the police were watching us and would drop spike strips to run us off the road. So we sat in the car for another 20 minutes before she said fuck it and drove us home, telling me I'd be more comfy if I was tripping out in bed instead of in public. I think I passed the peak somewhere on the drive home because my vision and hearing started to come back to me, and as soon as we got into the house I descended from paranoid mania into just being super fucking stoned. I fell asleep almost immediately in my bed and I was still ripped when I woke up for work the next day.

I was mentally fucked up for about two weeks after this experience. I felt semi-stoned for a solid 3 days and my memory was affected for the next 3 weeks. After a while, I tried to just laugh it off, and decided to try to smoke again. Well, it happened again, not nearly to the same degree but just enough to make me uncomfortable instead of fun-stoned. My mind just began to race and my anxieties really blew up. As soon as I took a puff, everything that had worried or troubled me that week immediately came to the front of my brain and it was all I could think about. I could no longer stand to be stoned around anyone other than my wife, as I felt they were all judging and laughing at me. So I just kinda stopped smoking. That was two years ago and every time since then that I've smoked, I'd had some degree of anxiety that made it unpleasant. I get so lost in my own head and very often spiral into a mild panic attack unless I'm at home with my wife and I can distract myself with a video game or something.

I do feel like this experience has permanently affected my brain as it relates to anxiety. Despite being in a better living situation today - better job, more money, more stability - than I was when this happened, I'm way more on edge most of the time. I live in fear of another panic attack like that, because THC seems to amplify all of my deepest fears, which is insane because for 90% of my life it had the complete opposite effect.

1jquth1,Need Advice: Brother Overdosed on Homemade Weed Oil and Is Experiencing Severe Hallucinations and Panic Attacks,Anxiety,1743715724.0,3,1,"Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out because I'm really worried about my brother, and I‚Äôd appreciate any advice or similar experiences you might share. Recently, he made homemade weed oil using about 50 grams of weed. He consumed roughly 3 tablespoons on bread, which I later calculated to be an extremely high dose of THC (over 1,400 mg). Since then, he‚Äôs been experiencing severe symptoms that have left us all scared.

For the past 48+ hours, he‚Äôs had intense hallucinations and delusions‚Äîat one point, he even said things like, ‚ÄúI am dead, my mind tells me I am dead, y'all are liars, I'm dead and I watch devils.‚Äù He‚Äôs been having panic attacks and severe paranoia, which seems to fluctuate based on his environment (he was calmer in the park, but things escalated when we were on the street). Now, he‚Äôs at home and still struggling to find calm, even refusing to eat and showing signs of extreme distress.

We‚Äôve been to the hospital, and they‚Äôve prescribed him risperidone (a half pill of a 2 mg dose for tonight and the next few nights), and they suggested we see a psychiatrist tomorrow. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm trying to manage his panic attacks and keep him in a safe, calm environment. I‚Äôm particularly concerned about how to help him settle down and whether there‚Äôs anything specific I can do with his diet (like, would something like pineapple help?).

Has anyone been through something similar with a cannabis overdose or witnessed severe THC-induced psychosis? What techniques or interventions helped ease the symptoms? Any advice on dealing with the hallucinations and panic attacks would be really appreciated. I know this is a lot, but any insights or experiences you can share might help us get through this rough patch until professional help arrives.

1gupq65,Edible THC overdose ,Anxiety,1731993061.0,7,1,"Just had THE worst night of my life. Been a regular weed smoker for 18 years, regularly take edibles, bongs, dabs etc. and have what I would consider a very high tolerance. Fast forward to last night and I am in Bangkok with my partner trying out the local smoking scene. 

After 2 weeks in Thailand this was our final night and we had been partying, drinking and probably dehydrating ourselves quite a bit (as you do). We had been smoking throughout the trip and decided to buy some gummies to help knock us out on the flight back to London. WHAT A MISTAKE!!! 

The gummies came in packs of 2 and were 100mg of each, and with us not wanting to take them through customs we decided to eat a pack each. I would like to clarify my partner isn‚Äôt a heavy drinker in the slightest whereas when I‚Äôm on holiday I do enjoy beers daily and when we go out to party it will often mean rum, tequila etc. however she has just a strong a tolerance as myself for the weed. 

The gummies were labelled as fast acting, and tasted awful, very chemically and you could feel them almost numbing our mouths as we chewed. 

Within about 30 minutes I could feel something felt terribly wrong, I had a sudden hot flash and had to excuse myself from the restaurant we were at to go and splash some water on my face and try and calm down. After about 10 minutes I returned to the restaurant and told my partner I wasn‚Äôt sure I could deal with the upcoming 12+ hour flight, and that I was starting to feel a little bit paranoid. Not even a minute later I feel my heart start absolutely pounding out of my chest, visibly shaking my t shirt. With this I started to full on panic, couldn‚Äôt catch my breath and was starting to feel like I was losing my mind. I need to reinforce how bad this actually was, it felt like what I can only presume a stroke would feel like. 

I had shooting pains in my arms, my thoughts became totally delirious until I fully disassociated with myself, not being able to comprehend where I was, who I was with or even who I was. I then began having severe heart palpitations which made my legs go completely numb and I was only held up by my partner literally pushing me against the wall. 

We went to the pharmacy in the airport to ask for some help, who then checked my blood pressure and heart rate, which was over 195bpm. This prompted them to call a team of medics who instantly put me on an IV drip and began taking ECG readings, followed swiftly by putting me on a stretcher and taking me to the hospital. 

I can not explain the feeling I had, I was fully convinced this was going to be the end of my life and felt I was going completely insane in my mind. 

I am wondering what caused this severe reaction, I have regularly taken edibles of similar and higher MG levels of THC and never had anything even remotely close to this. I am guessing it was due to the drink in my system and the dehydration, but damn this was a brutal experience which has scared me off of edibles for good. I am also wondering whether the mg count was much higher than the packet suggested. 

Thanks for reading and be careful if you‚Äôre doing edibles!! ",overdose

Intense visual and auditory hallucinations but not like a ‚Äúpsychedelic‚Äù hallucination it looked just as real as everything else around me but it wasn‚Äôt, more like a schizophrenic hallucination. Before this overdose I never had anxiety or mental health issues at all but ever since that day it has been almost unbearable, the physical symptoms of anxiety.
Anyone else had this happen to them? Any advice on how to fix it? Anyone know why or how this happened? Like the actual reason, like did I fuck up some wiring or chemicals in my brain?",overdose
14awbmz,Prednisone Withdrawal Anxiety,Anxiety,1686920573.0,264,69,"First time poster in this subreddit and I wanted to detail my experience so that people in the future with the same issues I had could find this thread. 

I was prescribed a 12 day 60mg taper of prednisone for poison ivy last month. The day after stopping the recommended taper, I started having extreme anxiety. From what my doctor said, this is due to your adrenal glands not producing enough cortisol (prednisone was producing artificial cortisol). Once I stopped the medication, my body was not able to handle the high stress I was used to dealing with (two kids and newborn baby, remodeling house by myself, work, and overall family issues).

I was prescribed hydroxyzine and Xanax (I only took the hydroxyzine). It was a miserable amount of anxiety and overall fatigue. 

There are a lot of posts on here that anxiety is curable through breathing exercises, mindfulness, etc‚Ä¶ (which I don‚Äôt disagree with) but in certain circumstances your body may have some physiological issues that need to be addressed foremost. 

Anyway.. I just wanted to post this for guidance for anyone else experiencing prednisone withdrawal. Feel free to message me in the future if you need someone to talk to because this was the worst anxiety of my life",withdrawal

Anyway, I chose to taper off the med and stop it cause it has horrblle side effects made me feel like a zombie. I tapered for 2 weeks and then stopped it, im on day 8 now but im still getting high HR episodes (120-130 maybe), especially when standing from a laying down position ( which never happened to me before) or like going on the stairs and also eating a big meal things like that.

Post Covid complications and unexplained anxiety

I weaned off after 10 months and quit in January end


Withdrawal symptoms that no one talks about :
I am healthy male 28 yo weight 82kgs
No health issues

I quit Paroxetine in Jan end 2022
First withdrawal was tension headaches in Feb 2022 that lasted for 2 weeks
March 2022 : tension headaches reoccurrence along with acid reflux unexplained 
April 2022 : acid reflux reoccurrence along with pharyngitis and throat issues 
Soft palate red and ulcers all over the mouth
May 2022 : stomach ache issue along with a little headache and dehydration that came out of no where
All blood tests and complete tests were done and all markers were clear
June 2022 : sudden frequent urination which was again unexplanatory that I had resolved by itself in July 2022

And during this period
The constant anxiety momentarily relapses and your brain saying maybe we should resume paxil??

1jjm6oz,I am afraid of the side effects of Xanax withdrawals.,Anxiety,1742916838.0,36,21,"I've been taking 0.5mg Xanax for about 3 years from inconsistent phycologists. 1st time was prescribed once a day. 2nd was 2 times a day. 3rd was 3 times a day. I was already on an ADHD medication (for 20 years) on top of that and Prozac (Before Xanax) making this situation real unsettling. On top of that, I vape. Now, my body's shaking, my chest feels like its slightly burning, and I'm afraid. The new doctor just cut me off from Xanax without any further explanation than me already having a controlled substance prescribed (35mg Dexmethylphenidate). I have not seen the doctors faces and I was already in blindly trusting it over visiting the counselor a few times. I think the Clinic has stopped the visits after I found a job. The 2 phycologists, I never met face to face, only over the phone. This is I suppose day 4 after the last Xanax, of my withdrawal and I am lost.

  
Update: Thank you everyone for the support and advices! I really appreciate it! Unfortunately, I'm not going to reply to each comment atm but I did read them and upvoted. Also, reading that most of you had went through similar situations shows that I'm not alone in this. Sorry that y'all went through those experiences but glad for your recovery, even in process. I'm not trying to say that ""benzo is completely bad"", just a fear of having 2 control substances prescribed without proper monitoring and blind trust. I just went to a hospital yesterday night, got examined, and was prescribed with a temporary replacement to help me with the Xanax withdrawal. It's a bit rocky with the day 5, but I am getting there.",withdrawal

If so, how long did withdrawal last?",Anxiety,1668377526.0,256,101,"Worth stipulating that I understand everyone is different and such - but keen to hear other‚Äôs experiences. I‚Äôve been on Escitalopram for about 7 years for anxiety (don‚Äôt have depression apart from feeling depressed about my anxiety). 

I‚Äôve tapered super slowly (1 month of 1 day off, one day on, then one month of 2 days off one day on etc. and finally down to 4 days off, one day on and the doctor said she‚Äôs happy for me to just stop now). The last I took was 10mg on Thursday. Getting panic attacks and heightened anxiety which I expected but the thing I‚Äôm really struggling with is feeling lightheaded and dizzy. 

Really unpleasant and slightly freaking out at the thought that it could last ages. Or also worried that somehow I‚Äôm too imbalanced and will always be dizzy unless I go back on.  

Anyway, would be great to hear other‚Äôs experiences to get an idea of expectations. Thank you!",withdrawal
1chcqk4,Beware of SSRI withdrawal ,Anxiety,1714535908.0,113,29,"Sharing this in case it helps anyone else. So a couple of months ago I weaned off Prozac after being on it for 7 years (with the help of a GP, not psychiatrist),  and within a couple weeks of finishing it, I started having terrible symptoms, including:

- Nocturnal panic attacks
- Sleep paralysis (hadn‚Äôt had it in years)
- irritability 
- sense of doom 
- emotional over everything 
- brain zaps 
- feeling like I was going crazy 

I didn‚Äôt think it could be a withdrawal from Prozac because it had been a couple of weeks since I had been off it. So I  thought it could just be my Generalized Anxiety flaring up, and I‚Äôve been feeling so hopeless over it. I finally went to a psychiatrist and he told me it was likely Prozac withdrawal, and turns out that withdrawal can last as long as six months. I didn‚Äôt wean off the medication long enough. This whole time I thought all my symptoms were just my GAD back to normal (as in normal = bad), and while some of them are probably just my usual anxiety, it‚Äôs most likely withdrawal given how severe they are. 

So just a friendly reminder to always consult with a psychiatrist when weaning off SSRIs and remember that withdrawal can take a while. ",withdrawal
isb5dz,Hydroxyzine withdrawal???,Anxiety,1600046652.0,322,86,"Anytime I miss a day of hydroxyzine i feel fine but if i go two days it‚Äôs like over. I vomit and feel panicky and am forced to take my pills. I know hydroxyzine treats nausea too so I‚Äôm wondering if this is like a kind of rebound from not taking it? Anyone else have similar experiences with this?


UPDATE: this keeps getting new comments even 3 years later so I wanted to tell yall what eventually came of it. Over the course of several weeks I weaned the meds until I didnt need them anymore. Let me be clear, I still have anxiety, I just got to the point where I can manage without meds. I had to change a lot of my lifestyle and adopt healthy habits (healthy diet, daily exercise, cutting back on weed, no more vaping, getting good grades) to get my anxiety to a good place. I was originally taking 2 25mg (50mg total) pills daily usually before bed. I began weaning by taking 1.5 pills then 1 pill then .5 and then .25. I am no longer prescribed this and if I truly truly need an emergency anxiety fix (I avoid doing this now because I believe that anxiety is just a part of my life and that I shouldn‚Äôt numb it without attacking the root cause) I take benadryl and that works very well. Good luck everyone!

UPDATE 2: I can't believe the comments that this is still getting 4 years later! I am going to continue to keep this thread open and continue to respond to folks. To anyone who was prescribed this, I wont say don't take it but DO NOT take it daily and do not let it become habitual. To anyone stuck on this medication: myself and lots of others are having success weaning off of it over the course of a few weeks. I know how tough anxiety is just hang in there and my DMs are always open if you have questions!",withdrawal

1awteln,Ativan withdrawal after just four weeks of low-dose use?,Anxiety,1708564383.0,81,9,"My wife was prescribed Ativan for anxiety and insomnia related to some health issues. She took .5 mg per night for four weeks, and on just a few days during that period, she took an extra .5 mg pill during the day to help with an anxiety attack. 

  
At right around four weeks, she stopped cold turkey. Her doctor didn't really give us any guidance on the risks, how long to take it, whether to taper, nothing. So we didn't think much of it. But now she has had terrible insomnia and anxiety for several nights in a row -- can't sleep at all and now she's terrified that she's permanently screwed up her sleep because of the Ativan.

I had to switch off Lexapro to Brintellix, and it‚Äôs been hell on earth. Just for clarification: I‚Äôve taken Lexapro since I was 11, which means for a little over 8 years my brain has been addicted to it, consuming it non-stop (never considered taking a break since I suffer from major depressive disorder).  

My doctor told me to go cold turkey since my dose wasn‚Äôt too high. Looking back at it, it was a very BAD idea. 

I had the worst case of brain zaps. Whenever I walked or moved my eyes, my brain would zap the left side of my body, occasionally both. I was nauseous and dizzy, cold sweats were a daily occurrence. Thought I was having a stroke or something. 

14 days in, I finally got rid of the brain zaps. But the left side of my body still aches and my muscles twitch. I have no idea if muscle aches/stiffness is related to withdrawal? I am pretty worried since I have severe health anxiety, and Google hasn‚Äôt been helpful in the slightest. Also, I thought I would be fine after the brain zaps went away, which is a huge indicator of Lexapro withdrawal??? It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me in the slightest, it‚Äôs like my body is fighting me.

I never attempted it and can‚Äôt even cut my arm. So I stop having it because it‚Äôs not gonna happen.

For a while, I think the reasoning behind this is because I‚Äôm a coward, I couldn‚Äôt end the pain of living so I have to live like you‚Äôre half alive and half dead at the same time. Recently, I talk about this to a lad I know, and he said that wasn‚Äôt cowardice, that was bravery. 

Because despite all the shit that happens to me and around me and in the world, I still choose to live. Despite growing up in a dysfunctional family, despite not studying that much in school and potentially not getting into college, despite the world being a shitty place where the rich gets richer where the rest burns in hell. Despite all of that odds, I‚Äôm still here. Not living fully, but still breathing, that‚Äôs a plus for me I guess, I am crawling but I am moving slowly.

I was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn‚Äôt really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn‚Äôt. 

I experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn‚Äôt stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he‚Äôs Never been impressed by anyone‚Äôs German before!!!

I never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do.

1j8k5dj,Can't decide if I just have a maladaptive coping mechanism or if something else is going on,Anxiety,1741673005.0,0,2,"So I (20m) have been dealing with this... thing in my mind for about three years. I say thing because I'm not sure what it is. I have diagnosed disorders, including dissociative tendencies, but I also have an over active imagination, along with a lovely history of multiple sources of trauma. I am barely getting over said trauma and I am becoming aware of maladaptive coping mechanisms that I have developed over time. 

About three years ago during a period of involuntary social withdrawal (emotionally unstable mother/always sucked at being social appropriate/kids at school turned out to be liars) if about a year I wrote a random silly story and I drew one of the characters. And well I thought he looked pretty hot, and instantly I fell in love with this drawing. It wasn't a remarkable drawing, just a doodle. I immediately started fantasizing about a life with this man, had nothing to do with the story, I just fell in love with how he looked, and I created someone in my mind I could fantasize about, and how much I would've loved for him to come get me out of my unfortunate circumstances. And this persisted, I said at the beginning that I was in complete control of it and as long as I wasn't having hallucinations then it wasn't anything concerning. Well obviously it spiraled out of control, more and more I just wanted to find *him*, wherever he was, so that he could help me get my life together, and I started to believe he was real. I imagined every way we could meet, and I always was thinking of him, and waiting, and how my life would be happy and he would be there. 

Well I haven't always had the best luck with dating, and that wasn't changing any time soon, you don't need to be dating when you're a teenager, but I was a dropout. Whenever I was able to go out, I was always looking for him around the corner, but he was never there. I went off to job corps, and was obsessed with hoping he would be there, and nothing could prevent us from being together, I began to believe he was real, I began to imagine his memories, I made up his whole life and I started to convince myself it was real, and that he was coming, I just had to wait. Well whoopsies got kicked out(no I'm not telling) on my 18th birthday, got sent home right to the pit of my trauma, and it took me three months to get a grip on myself, acknowledge that I was a damn adult, and I hopped out the window to go be homeless cus my mom was not ready for me to independent at all, but she was only making mental dysfunction even worse and it was the best option for me. Well now I was out on the streets, running around with this delusion of a savior partner, if only we would meet, and I started getting connected with resources that would help me get on my feet, and two months later I got myself a job, but whoopsies, burned out too hard because my mental health was still junk and couldn't handle working, had adequate work performance for 7 months, except for all the gaps when I didn't, and then at the end I was given an ultimatum and I quit. Took the last paycheck and drove six hours to a whole new town, convinced myself he must be there, oh yes I didn't stop thinking every day that I just had to keep working and he would show up and my life would ""begin"" and I wouldn't have to worry about a financial or companionship need ever again. Lol, that still wasn't in the cards for me, and I slept in my car for three weeks waiting for him to show up, very embarrassing looking back now, and well because he's not real, he's not real at all, he has never breathed a breath of air, he didn't show up. Week long phsyc ward visit later and I took this ring I had gotten for him and I threw it off a bridge, really wish I would've waited longer to try to sell it but oh well. And it had been a whole year of homelessness between the two towns combined and I got myself into a transitional living facility, and started working on dismantling this thing.

During this time I fought tooth and nail with myself to force myself into any relationship that was at least with an actual person, lol nope still not in the cards for me, so I gave up on dating apps or hookups, I really did try to be social in public too, but I couldn't seem to find anyone in my age range, so I've just thrown my arms up and given up on even trying. I forgot to mention that beyond the delusions of thinking this man was real, I also believed he was God and that I had a duty to love him to restore power to God so that I could escape Earth, that whole thing in the middle, very embarrassing. I told a therapist that I had(past tense) delusions of grandeur and he remarked that usually people don't break their own delusions, well I did, so that's that. I mention this because there was very much an alleged spiritual aspect to this, or at least I thought so, but everything has pointed me in the direction of ""no he's not real or your soul mate, drop it"" which I am trying to do, but I can't. And that's my problem.

I moved up to live with family in a third town, and I'm going to college, my grades are good and I'm getting better each day. But he's still there. I've tried all sorts of prayer, I've tried to villanize him, I've tried to ignore urges to seek him out, I've tried so much to make myself understand that just because my mom was unhinged that doesn't mean the rest of my family is, I've tried to surround myself with social support so that I won't feel like thinking of him, but he's always there, always there to hold me, always there to accompany me. Now let me be clear, I have never had a visual/auditory hallucination in my life. I have never spoken to him, and he has never spoken to me, he exists entirely within my imagination. And that's what's bothering me, and what has led me to believe that he is just a maladaptive coping mechanism, my brain provided me a companion during a very traumatic and isolated part of my life and now I can't make him go away, he is going to be there until he is no longer needed. And I don't think that's fair, I don't think it's fair that I can't figure out what this thing is, that both mental and spiritual work has not gotten rid of him, how could it? I structured my whole survival off of finding him, I imagined a life time together with him. When I say I thought of him all the time, I meant it, I wanted him every minute of the day. I've gotten far enough over the last year to at least be willing to say he's not real, but there's still that part of me that is holding out for him, and I just want it gone, I want that energy and hope to help in other parts of my healing, I don't want to hold on to it anymore, I don't know what's wrong with me, and I'm tired of having to restart therapy because I keep moving and now I'm in a small ass town that doesn't have a wide variety of therapists to choose from, not anyone who's specially trained for whatever is wrong with me, and this damn imaginary friend/dissociative business always gets steamrolled by all the other damn trauma I still haven't processed and I don't know how to get help for it because I can't even label it, it's treatment resistant, I refuse to take antipsychotics because I do not have schizophrenia and when I was placed on Abilify wayyy before this whole business started (about 9 months before that fateful date for 7 days, forced on to me because I kept ""lashing out"" and yelling at my mom because she victimized me) I felt awful, constant leg tremors and fatigue that made me actually unstable, and I feel like restricting my dopamine would just kill my personality, I think it would kill ""me"". Antidepressants (SSRI's/SNRI's) do not work on me at all, tried them for years and years and only got fat from them, (they also don't work if you're actually stuck in a traumatic living environment where you're constantly exposed to hopelessness/helplessness) antianxiety meds actively make me depressed, and all I got out of this is an OCD diagnosis, still don't know what to do with it. 

I just- I don't need a relationship, having one entirely in my mind has just burned me out. But he's still there, to fill in the gaps whenever some part of me calls out to him, always a loyal companion, taunting me with what I can't have. I wish I could look at my family and feel cared for. I wish I could sit by myself without dissociating/daydreaming. I wish I could pin point what this was, and make it stop. He won't go away until he is no longer needed, but you know that idea of ""if you keep wishing for something you're not gonna get it""? Well I believe that, and I believe that I just don't get to have a relationship in this life, not as long as he won't go away. I want him gone because I now believe he is stopping me from enjoying life and recovering. Or should I just accept it? Should I stop feeling so distressed about his presence? I just get so sad cuddling with my pillows, I don't want to be so obsessed with a romantic relationship, I wish I could believe my family and friends when they say they care, I want to live life in the moment, and not in some far off place in my mind. My psych was thinking of looking into drug based therapies since I believe in medical marijuana, but in the meantime I just don't know what to do with myself.",i cant go on

I was told these were panic attacks and I was stressed, but I didn't feel stressed and my heart rate never went up during these episodes.

I made a previous master-post on my long-term anxiety symptoms (which I overcame) where I went over the more bizarre, rarely spoken about, constant symptoms of long-term anxiety, and the feedback loop and it seemed to help a lot of people. I will link that one below, I recommend everyone read it first!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10jcfko/longterm_anxiety_symptoms_i_had_from_someone_who/

A lot of you wanted to know how I overcame the DP/DR symptoms. I didn't realise that I had message requests on Reddit, and now I've got so many spanning across months ago that I can't find the time to get back to individually so I feel like its my duty to make this post and have it all in one place. Warning, this is a big post.

Lets go over some positives first as I find its always best to get off on a positive note, and to have something to look forward to or motivate others:

**1. DP/DR (Depersonalization and Derealization) is not and is never permenant, anyone who says so are catastrophizing and are probably biased or feeling that way due to their own condition not improving. These notions are not helpful and are also not true.**

**It will and can go away 100%, it is not something you have to 'deal' with or 'accept' for the rest of your life.**


**2. DP/DR does not work like a debt system e.g. the longer you are in DP/DR, the longer it is going to take you to get out of it (isn't true!). Everyone has the same chance of success in recovering from DP/DR, no matter how long or short you have been in that state.**
**3. DP/DR is not indicative or a sign of psychosis, and you will not become psychotic if you experience DP/DR.**


DP/DR is a **defense mechanism**, which attempts to make sure that only the body experiences pain or trauma and not the mind, by causing detachment. **Causes of DP/DR can be anxiety attacks, severe stress, health anxiety, drug induced (often from edibles or hallucinogens), traumatic first-hand or second-hand situations, abuse or any interpersonal trauma. Anyone of any age can experience DP/DR.**

.......................................................................

**What does DP/DR feel like?:**

- Everything feels (and looks) either too close or too far away from you, environments are distorted
- Everything feels flat or 2D, like it isn't quite real or tangible, others faces might feel unreal
- Can feel like the world is slipping away from you
- You might feel like you could fall over any second or fall through the floor
- Speech can feel slow/slurred, like your brain is struggling to find words
- Time can feel like its going too fast or too slow
- Feeling like you can observe yourself outside your body, everything feels disconnected, like you are very alone
- Your limbs can feel too small, too big, like you are taller or shorter than you actually are
- You might feel internally dizzy (like your mind is spinning but your vision isn't), woozy head feelings, fuzzy head
- More frequent feelings of nostalgia/dejavu
- Colours can feel more dull or distorted
- Feeling numb, like your memories are less tangible or unreal
- Hypochondria (Healthy Anxiety) is often a huge comorbidity with DP/DR

.......................................................................

**The Feedback Loop, what is it?**

Symptoms of DP/DR (as well as Anxiety/Health Anxiety) are often kept alive by or started something called the **Feedback Loop.** This is a loop that is constantly being fed into, which could have started from something as for example:

*You may be minding your own business one day and suddenly experience a Panic Attack, but you misread it as being something worse. You could think you're about to die, that you are having a heart attack because of the palpitations, that you could collapse any moment now, and then it goes... but you're on edge, what if it happens again? Do I have a heart condition? I think I'm dying, I think something is wrong. Everyday you are waking up and checking if you can feel palpitations, you're scared it will happen again, you're getting waves of dread, your mind is full of 'what ifs' over and over again every single day. Then one day, nothing feels real and you feel completely detached from reality and this scares you even more, you feel like you're slipping away, you're terrified and feel like you'll never be normal again. You're waking up everyday to check if everything still feels unreal, and it does, its not going away. Whats happening?*


This is the **Feedback Loop** example which led to DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms. What should've happened when you experienced for example: a Panic Attack, was that **you should've been able to realise it was a Panic Attack and been able to ground yourself or calm down during that situation and it would go away. This would eliminate the start of the Feedback Loop**, but instead by misreading the situation or not having the appropriate tools to manage it, you are now in fear, in high stress and feeling traumatised of the situation in fear it will happen again or that something worse is happening to you. This keeps the Loop alive and going.

**In preparation for the pain or fear you are about to anticipate happening, your body chose to disassociate from your mind and cause DP/DR in order to handle the stress and fear of what you're afraid of experiencing. DP/DR is attempting to save you from what could happen to you next, after being activated from something that already hurt you or traumatised you.**

Identifying the first source of your DP/DR can be particularly important in understanding and learning where your Feedback Loop started. **For some people it can even extend to as far as childhood, which can sometimes result in something known as DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)**. Once you have identified the source, this is the stepping stone into recovering from DP/DR.

Sources of DPDR can be: drug-induced from hallucinogens/edibles/bad trips/alcohol or other substances, anxiety attacks, depression, stress, medical trauma/childhood trauma/adulthood trauma/being a child of divorce, sexual assaults/CSA, PTSD, DID and more

Environments are also very important to be recognised as sources of DPDR e.g. stressful jobs, stressful/abusive relationships, difficult home life, being a full-time carer for family, difficult school life etc

.......................................................................

**So what's going to help me get better?**

There's a lot of resources and therapies available for DP/DR, such as Psychotherapy (talking therapies), CBT, DBT, EMDR and more.

But what is most important is that you are able to help yourself, as well as having professional support should you require it. **The thing that is going to get you better the most is you, and the tools you can develop to help you in time of need and in how you navigate the world and your trauma**. Some people (like me) may be able to recover from DP/DR without professional intervention or therapies, but it is always incredibly recommended if you have access or can afford it. **With DP/DR being highly trauma related, it is important to have a safe place to unload and traverse trauma with a professional**, as it can be tough to handle alone. **If you are concerned or suspect your DP/DR may be a result of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder), professional help is absolutely necessary.**

Every person with DP/DR will be completely unique in their needs, what they can handle alone or what they need support with.

.......................................................................

**What can we do for ourselves?**

This is going to go over some self-practices and tools you can do in your own time to help yourself while actively experiencing DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms, and also how to reduce the chances of re-experiencing it when you are recovered.

**Staying Busy & Challenging Yourself:**

A big part of dissolving the Feedback Loop is by no longer feeding into it, and one way of doing this is by diverting our thoughts from the feelings of DP/DR or anxiety symptoms. **You want to find or make opportunities where you don't have time to think about DP/DR, or how it makes you feel, 'scanning' for feelings or signs of it, and to challenge those feelings instead.**
**DP/DR and anxiety is the perfect time to get busy and involved with life**, whether it is your hobbies, being with your friends and family, doing chores that need to be done, starting things you've always wanted to do. **It can feel scary, even terrifying to partake in these things when you feel unreal, like you're not present or that the world is slipping away, but you must keep pushing through**. Once you begin to challenge yourself and challenge those feelings of 'not feeling real' you begin to establish trust within yourself.

**Don't be disheartened that DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms do not disappear right away overnight, this is because your body hormonally, needs time to acclimate to low levels of stress and anxiety after having been kept at such high levels. If these hormones were to plummet immediately, the body wouldn't be able to cope, so it likes to decline it gently! So consider it like you are establishing trust:**

DP/DR has been in the drivers seat all this time, and you've been the passenger in the back. You're finally insisting on being in the driver's seat, but DP/DR insists on being the passenger right next to you. DP/DR is going to freak out in the passenger seat and take the wheel from you at times during some tough situations because its not sure you can navigate it on your own, and instead of letting it take the driver's seat again you need to say to it, 'Don't worry. I've got this'. and DP/DR will let go of the wheel. This in real life, would be an example of you handling the situation you are in and challenging yourself to face what makes you afraid (such as going outside in case you feel 'unreal').

**By doing this, you are establishing trust and are giving DP/DR the opportunity to know that you can handle the situation on your own. Eventually with time of practicing these things, DP/DR will get out of the car entirely and you can 'drive' all by yourself again and those feelings of DP/DR will be gone. You'll be able to live your life without things like anxiety or DP/DR dictacting where it takes you or how it makes you feel. You will have formed that trust that you can handle experiencing your pain, your fear, your trauma, your anxiety/stress etc. without the need of the defence mechanism of DP/DR. You will become the first line of defence!**

From personal experience this is what accelerated me to my complete recovery from DP/DR and long-term anxiety symptoms within 3-4 months of this practice after struggling for almost a year of non-stop DP/DR and anxiety symptoms. **I learned to empathise with my DP/DR's attempt at trying to keep me safe and acknowledged that it was only doing this in order to make me feel better, albeit in a scary and inconvenient way! So by learning techniques and also teaching myself not to be scared of DP/DR symptoms or my anxiety symptoms, I gave myself the opportunity to be the one in control and say ''Hey, I am totally capable of caring for myself now. Thank you for your help and what you tried to do for me'' to my DP/DR.**

By feeling afraid to participate in activities or doing things because you might feel unreal, or because the world feels distorted, you are allowing DP/DR to maintain control and are keeping DP/DR as an option

**Challenge yourself in incriments or in steps, and remember to reward yourself afterwards. Figure out what about DP/DR makes you afraid:**

**is it seeing people's faces? particularly friends or family?** - challenge yourself towards looking at faces, engaging with familiar faces (YouTubers, family, partners), if you can touch their face then touch it, grounding exercises where you say ''I can see two eyes, they are [insert colour], they have a [description] nose, do they have freckles? birth marks? do they have any smile lines? identify parts of their face and describe them'' this helps make them more tangible and less scary. Do little challenges before the bigger ones.

**is it going outside in case you feel unreal? woozy?** - challenge yourself towards small, short walks up and down your street, to eventually longer walks, acknowledge that you might be feeling dizzy/unreal but that you are safe, be kind & go home if you need it, try again another day, stay engaged with your hobbies/the outside world

**is it the feeling that you'll never be the same again? that you think its permenant? that you've ruined your life?** - The first thing you'll see if you look up 'can dpdr be permenant' is 'no!' and every other article will say no. There has never been an observed case of DPDR being permenant, and you won't be the first case of that happening. Its really important you do not entertain or engage with people who believe it is permenant, or that theirs is permenant because they are just people who are keeping their own DPDR alive with the negativity. I recommend writing positive affirmations or reading them, and engaging with positive stories of DPDR recovery and sticking with facts. **You have not ruined your life, and you will recover.**
**DPDR can make you feel afraid of lots of things, not just the ones I described above (but those are the most common).**

**Grounding Exercises:**
Grounding is a way to refocus and bring your attention back to the present and the world around you. This is can be used when experiencing fear or anxiety of your current DP/DR state, but is **most effective when you feel like it is 'coming on' or you are experiencing anxiety/stress that could lead to it.**

Grounding exercises can involve:

- Naming 5 things you can see, name 4 things you can touch and to touch them, naming 3 things you can hear and listening to them, what 2 things can you smell, 1 thing you can taste.
- Holding ice cubes, putting your hands in cold water, picking up or touching things and explaining how it feels (is it cold, warm, does it feel rough or soft), identifying their colours deeply
- Walks without music, tuning into the sounds of your steps, counting your steps, observing your surroundings on your walks, sitting in the grass and touching it.
- Mental anchoring by saying (in your head or quietly to yourself) your full name, your age, where you live, what street you live on, the date, where you are, what you're doing. Repeat this gently until you feel calm.
- Self-assurance phrases such as, ''You are okay'', ''Nothing can hurt me'', ''You will get through this'', ''I've done this once and I can do it again'' etc.

.......................................................................

**My Example of How I Personally Recovered from DPDR:**

For me I dealt with a lot of wooziness/dizziness during my DP/DR and I felt terrified to do anything sitting up or standing because I'd have to acknowledge that dizzy feeling and the unreal-ness from DP/DR, so I would lie on my side all day while watching TV or playing games instead to cope. **I wanted to turn 'Oh god, no I'm dizzy and woozy and nothing feels real, I'm so scared' into 'Oh I'm dizzy and feel unreal today? Lets see what I can manage'.**

It started to become more of 'Let's get up! Lets engage with the same hobbies but lets sit up this time'. I'd do that for as long as I feel I could handle the dizzines and unreal sensations, and then I'd lie back down again. I rewarded myself and cared for myself with a technique that brought me comfort, while having succeeded in engaging with something that scared me or was difficult. Over time I'd start to sit up for longer, or I'd start to go outside on short walks (which was particularly hard as I'd feel more unreal outside than at home), and I would feel unreal, like everything was flat, like the world was slipping away but I did it.

Some days I would just cry or feel like I took steps back, that I'd be stuck forever but I kept going and I kept rewarding myself after those times with either little lie downs, eating things I really loved, engaging in self-care or watching familiar TV shows I know I loved. Over time I started to sit up a lot more, I started to stand more, I started to go out more and for much, much longer each time, I started to do all the things I loved again despite how I felt. **Don't get me wrong, I still felt unreal and dizzy but I wanted to stop being scared of it and to not let it stop me engaging with things I loved or wanted to do.**

**I stopped basing my days and thoughts on 'how good I'm feeling' and more so on 'how well can I manage today'.** That took away a lot of pressure for me, as I knew I would not feel better over night but I would learn to manage my days better, so focusing on that intrinsically helped me feel better. You'll want to learn how to manage bad days (whether DPDR days, anxious days, stressful days) because when you do, you'll become prepared for if you ever face any of those times again and you can conquer it!

One day after months of challenging myself, being more present, doing my hobbies, going outside (I remember this vividly) I was hugging my partner and I looked up at his face and I physically jumped, **he looked real. I started looking around everywhere and everything felt real, everything looked so colorful, the world didn't feel flat or distorted, everything felt 'real' and 'right' and when I touched my partner's face it felt so tangible and real.** I don't think I've ever cried that hard in my life from happiness, my DPDR was gone.

Everything probably felt like this for a while, but because I was so engrossed in engaging with the world around me and doing the things I loved I didn't actually realise it, because I was no longer questioning my reality or looking for signs of DP/DR. **So that one moment where I finally remembered to 'check' my reality, it made me realise everything felt real again and that I felt human again. And it never came back.**

When you feel ready, the key is to be kind to yourself as well as challenge yourself against your DPDR and how it makes you feel. By pushing through and engaging with the world around you bit by bit you will start to establish that trust, those tools, in convincing your body that you can handle yourself and that it no longer needs to detach with DPDR to keep you safe.

.......................................................................

**Some habits to get into, and some to get rid of:**

- **Cut out all alcohol and all drugs absolutely and completely, as well as caffeine & reduce or quit smoking.** All of these substances will have an effect on the hormones in your body, and can impede progress from DP/DR due to the sensations it can produce and will generally stress out the body, and mind-altering drugs like hallucinogens or Cannabis can worsen DP/DR greatly or keep it around. *If you are an addict or suffer from addictions, get in touch with services that can help you taper, detox or navigate potential sobriety, do not attempt any of this alone.*

- **Establish a normal bedtime routine**, ideally getting into bed at 9-10pm and waking up before 9am. Some people need more sleep than others so wake up at whatever time in the morning before 9am is best for you; getting adequate sleep will greatly improve the rate of which your DP/DR can dissolve as your mind will be most lucid, alert and prepared to handle potential stressors. **Sleeping too much or too little can greatly affect your brain and hormone regulation, and you need the best hormone regulation in order for the body to lower cortisol levels which leads to DP/DR symptoms rapidly improving.**

- **Stay hydrated and well-fed.** This is really typical mental health advice, but in general you will want to make sure you are hydrated and well-fed so the body has enough energy supply to handle stressors, anxiety and to ensure the mind is as lucid and energised as possible. You will need all the energy you can possibly get, and having these bases covered can really improve your symptoms.

- **Get checked for any Vitamin Deficiencies** as a lot of Vitamins we can be deficient in will greatly effect circadian rhythms, heart rhythms, the brain (deficiencies can cause brain fog, low motor skill function and poor hormone regulation). **Making sure we have healthy, functioning foundations to work off of greatly supports mental function and our ability to take on new information and learn new things (such as therapeutic tools and treatment).**

- **Identify your stressors and reduce them, identify your triggers and navigate them.** Cortisol levels increase with stress (from stressors) and anxiety, when we are faced with high levels of cortisol for extended periods of time, the body can produce bizzare and scary symptoms (which are harmless).

1cxubrx,Anyone else afraid of death?,Anxiety,1716362105.0,243,408,"I'm scared to die. I know I'm young so it might not happen for a while, but i'm still afraid. I keep having a thought that goes, ""you'll never know when you'll fall asleep and never wake up."" I feel like that's the best way to die, but that's also bad because you never really know when it could happen. That's what scares me. You never know when you'll die.

I can't sleep now because of this. It's currently 2am and I have school in the morning. Finals are starting soon and I know I need sleep. But this thought won't leave my brain. It's making me afraid to sleep. Anyone else have these thoughts? How do you make them stop?

Edit: I'm going to add something. I'm scared of death and what might be on the other side. But I kinda just hope that I see my family when I die . I don't really care what else there is. I mainly just want to see my grandpas because they passed when I was young and I want to know them. What I really am afraid of is the feeling of dying. Like what does it feel like as you're dying? Is it painful? peaceful? Scary? are you even aware it's happening? ",i cant go on
10jcfko,Long-Term Anxiety Symptoms I Had! (from someone who has recovered/been free from them for 1+ year),Anxiety,1674480319.0,549,544,"Long-Term Anxiety/Long-term Stress Symptoms
I wanted to make a post in hopes to help a lot of you who are experiencing very strange, scary and difficult symptoms that you may not realise are a product of long-term and cyclical anxiety/health anxiety/stress. I felt inspired to make this post as even to this day, I am getting comments and messages on some of my previous posts about how I've made people feel better, less afraid and less alone as I've made their symptoms feel heard and like they are finally feeling safe and that what they are experiencing won't hurt them.

For small context of my story, I developed random Agoraphobia in late 2019, which escalated into very bad health anxiety through all of 2020 and some of 2021, all because of one singular panic attack. One panic attack that I misread for something serious, turned into a feedback loop of anxiety which ended up producing very scary, bizzare, and difficult symptoms. I have been free of these symptoms for what will have been over a year now as of this year after tackling my anxiety, and I'd love to help all of you feel at ease if you have any of these!

You don't have to be actively panicking or anxious to experience these, your body holds onto long-term built up anxiety/stress, it doesn't flush it all out immediately so you can experience these anytime after prolonged periods of these emotions. It gets much, much better over time.

- Dizziness (like the inside of your head is spinning but your vision isn't, sometimes to the point where you can't sit up or if you close your eyes it feels like you're spinning)

- Fuzzy Strange Head Feeling, wooziness, heaviness in the head
- Like the ground feels wobbly/like you'll fall over/like you're on a boat, like I'd fall through the floor

- Brain Zaps (without the presence of SSRI's. It'd feel like an elevator dropped inside my head, my head would 'zing' a lot, sometimes my vision would black out, my head would drop, I thought only SSRI withdrawal could do this but I found out thats not the case. I felt crazy.)

- Head Pressure or headaches (extreme pressure headaches that felt like it was constantly expanding, like I wanted to squeeze my head, so much pain, sharp pain, tension)

- Electricity feeling in the back of the neck at the base of the head (made me think I had MS)

- Derealization/Depersonalization (everything felt either too close or too far away, like everything wasn't real, looking at people felt like they were 2D cut-outs, nothing felt real or right, like the world was slipping away, this was my scariest symptom and worried it was permenant. I've never experienced it again since 2020, and I feel like my old self again)
**Edit 27th September 2023: I have finally made a big post on my DPDR recovery story, as well as advice, symptoms, reassuring facts/advice** https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/16thenk/how_i_overcame_dpdr_symptoms_feedback_loop/?

- Choking/Strangling Sensation in the throat or around the throat/gagging/globus sensation/neck tightness or stiffness

- Increased Phosphene Activity (for example, when you rub your eyes or press on closed eyes you see 'fireworks' or 'lights', I'd see them much more at night with my eyes closed trying to sleep, and they'd sometimes make shapes or patterns)

- Hypnagogic/Hypnapompic Hallucinations (not indicative of psychosis, normal phenomenon, its when you see afterimages at night just before sleeping or the second you wake up. I'd sometimes have a digital alarm clock afterimage stuck in my vision for a minute)

- Strange pulsing light around field of vision at night after opening eyes

- Increase in Afterimages (they've severely decreased since getting better/I don't notice if I have any anymore. I used to focus on them like crazy)

- Visual Snow (had it all my life, but it felt 'increased' during my anxiety. Truth is I was just focusing on it more and now I never notice it again)

- Random black dot in vision, disappears when I look at it (I don't get this at all anymore but it used to be constant)

- Tinnitus (again, had all my life but was 'worse' during my extreme anxiety. Its since got better greatly since I felt better)

- Floaters in vision (I don't get these but these are extraordinarily common in people with anxiety)

- Chest Tightness, Chest Pain, Ectopic Beats, Palpitations, Tingling in hands

- Feeling Hungry for Air, like you can't get a full satisfying breath, shortness of breath sensation

- Sleep Paralysis Increase

- Lots of random pain, soreness in any part of the body suddenly, ranges from sharp to dull, just always in pain one way or another (I'd get zygomatic pain, to my neck being tender)

- Tense jaw, like it couldn't relax

- Stomach pain, stomach upsetness, nausea, bowel urgency

- Feeling like your speech is slurred, slow or like your brain is lagging

- Increased Vivid dreams, hyperawareness of sleep sensations (such as racing train of thought, nonsense thoughts as your brain winds down for sleep), hypnic jerks

- Eye Pain/eye pressure, pain moving eyes around, pain in the socket

- Random feelings of dread, feeling like you are about to die/something is wrong

These are just some of the symptoms I remember off the top of my head, definitely leave comments if there's any you're experiencing that I haven't noted as I can also try to let you know if I had those symptoms, or if other Redditors have!

It took me longer than I'd like to admit that these are just symptoms of anxiety and not something greater; I was a non-stop Googler of every symptom and sensation and decided I had every disease under the sun like Meniere's Disease, MS, brain tumours, schizophrenia (even though I had absolutely no symptoms of it) etc. I felt like I was going to be like this forever, it affected me everyday of my waking life, I kept a diary everyday of my symptoms and how I felt until one day I never wrote in it again because I never had anything to write about. I got better, it gets better, you are all safe, you are not alone.

I'd be super happy to answer any questions, or to help any of you feel assured so please feel free to leave anything by that could get you the help or support you need.

**Edit (27th September 2023)**

**I have made a large post like this one, about my recovery from DPDR and how I managed it. I had a lot of questions and message requests based on this symptom alone and how I combatted it, but I'm struggling to reply individually to so many messages about it, so here it is:**

**Please give that post a look if you are curious about DPDR recovery, its symptoms, how it can start and some reassuring advice on it**

........................................................

**Edit 2 (17th January 2024)**
Hiya everyone!

I just wanted to say thank you so much to all of you who are still using this place as a resource, and a safe place to come to me for advice and reassurance!

**For future reference I'd really recommend that if any of you have questions, or need advice, that you reply to this thread instead of sending me private messages and I'll explain why!**

1. Its easier & faster for me to get back to you! When you make a comment I get a notification which allows me to see your concerns instantly. **When a private message is sent, it immediately goes into my 'Message Requests' which I never get a notification for and have to actively remember to check it everyday (which can be hard!). I've got over 40 message requests now, which has left me quite swamped and feeling helpless because I didn't see them sooner and don't know where to start/if I can. So I'd really recommend at least leaving a comment first in the thread before messaging me privately. I want to help!**

2. Leaving a comment means that other people can read your questions, and they can also read my answers! This allows people to find answers to their questions easier as they may have the same question in their minds that has been asked before, and they can find that its been asked & answered. This stops a flood of repeat questions, and allows public access of all the information and experiences I can provide. **It is absolutely imperative to me that all of the information, advice and questions here remain completely public, free of charge and can be revisitable.**

3. **I can understand some of what you may want to talk about is more private/personal, so in this case please leave a comment requesting to message me and allow me to give you permission to message me before you send a private message.** This allows me to remember to check my message requests, and confirms that I can give you the attention and shoulder to lean on that you may need. There are times I will be absent due to personal commitments and real life, so I want to be able to reassure you on when I have the time to get back to you.

Again, I just wanted to say thank you and that I am insanely grateful for and proud of everyone here. I hope you know this is written in good faith and not to shame anybody, **I just want to help all of you as much as I can so making it easier to navigate and accessible means that more people can get the help they need x**",i cant go on
1gikju2,This is how I solved 90% of my Anxiety,Anxiety,1730632446.0,86,565,"I wanted to share something that helped me tremendously when it comes to dealing with my anxiety, and something that increased my life satisfaction overall. If nothing, stick around for the funny story at the end.

**Who am I?**   
31 year old male who has had anxiety until the age of 30 - so, most of my life. I didn't know I had it until I started going to therapy.   
I was always the person who everyone told to ""relax"" - but I never know what that meant. I was relaxed *in my perception of myself*. Everyone told me I was always so ""tense"" - in my thinking and ways of life.  
I remember constantly going through tough (read: bad) situations in my mind; for example, in my thoughts, I was perhaps fighting someone or someone was attacking me from the shadows when I was walking in a shady alley (this never happened in real life, but my mind has made it up). I had a lot of thoughts where I argued with people - never to reach a happy ending or an agreement, it always ended with a conflict.

So, unrelated to all of this, I started going to psychotherapy. After a year of going perhaps once or twice a week, I started recognizing more and more what anxiety was. It was sometimes mixed with, what I like to call, depression - but my psychotherapist refuses to accept that, because it's not chronic. And I agree, it was not chronic, but more like daily occurences of emptied out reserves of happy molecules, and lack of ambition. (I also kind of solved this afterwards as well, so I might write a post in the future about that). So I was feeling bad during the day. And of course, had lots of negative thoughts - arguing with people, imagining bad outcomes in my day-to-day job, being rejected by people, and so on.

**What helped?**  
So, at the beginning of the year (2024), I had a lot of anxiety. Both related to work and to my health (incidentaly I had increased my salt intake during one week and my blood pressure suffered, so being the anxious person that I am, I kept imagining it going so bad that I'd die). And I started having some kind of flashes of anxiety - I never had those before, so the situation seemed to have gotten way worse than what it was previously. The flashes were manifested in increased heart rate and tensing up - probably my blood pressure suffered as well - and also an array of negative thoughts. 

So I was laying one night in my bed and was going through the flashes. I couldn't help them whatever I did. I told myself to ""just stop fucking thinking negatively"" and, of course, it didn't help. Then I started to realize something - it never helps anyone to tell them to *stop doing something*, but instead, reframe it & motivate someone to *start doing something*. That was the game changer. I told myself -  
\- Okay, you're arguing with someone in your mind right now. How about you hug them in, instead?   
So I did. And then:  
\- How about they also apologize to you and tell you you've been right all along? (this goes in the direction of the conflict I've been having with people, who in my mind were telling me I'm wrong about some things)  
And I did. And they apologized. 

And I started crying. I've felt like the turntable has happened (had to say it like that, I'm *The Office* fan).   
I was being engulfed with positive emotions, like my body started to heal finally from all the trauma.

Sadly (or luckily, because I was about to learn how to strengthen my positive thinking), another flash of anxiety & negative thoughts came up as I was having these nice thoughts, after such a long time.  
\- No, FUCK you! (I've said to myself)  
I managed to turn them around into something positive again. And more crying ensued. 

From this point on, I learned to start thinking positively in my life. And I found myself SMILING! Constantly!  
*How does that look like?* Well, I imagine goofy stuff which brings me lots of joy. For example, if I was at a pool and I walked by three girls (who by the way ignored me) I thought afterwards how they approached me and told me how nice I look. Or if I ended a call / job meeting which I didn't like how it went, I imagined in my head that it went exactly how I wanted it to go, and that everyone praised me for my contributions.

It didn't matter that this didn't happen (or maybe won't ever happen), and I wasn't delusional. I knew that I was imagining it, and that I cannot always be right, or that I cannot be the prettiest guy in the room and that everyone will like me.   
But in my mind, I was. And, boy, did that change my perspective on life. It manifested some *crazy good shit* into reality just became of my positive framing.

**What I learned from it**  
I learned that I had some unhealed trauma in my life - and you might have guessed it, about being right, about being liked, and so on. So in my mind I started making up situations where I was the prettiest, I was always right  and that I was having a lovely time with everyone - there were no arguments, fights, or things of that sort.

Now I have set up events in my calendar to remind me to think ""happy thoughts"" 2x per week, and for 10 minutes only. I come refreshed out of it. 

Whenever I am feeling bad, if I remember to reframe those feelings, or just think of something good happening to me. 

**Do you want to try it? How will you know if it works for you?**  
Please note, if you try this for yourself and it doesn't work - try to see if, when you shift around your perspective from bad to good, does your mind say: ""No, this can't be right. I cannot be this liked / loved / right / pretty""? If so, CONVINCE IT that it is fucking possible! Your mind will try to stop you at first, because it's been that way for years / decades, it probably  won't allow you to shift your perspective that fast. It might, but you also might need to ""battle it out"".  
You will know it works for you if:  
\- tension starts dropping  
\- you start feeling good throughout your body  
\- you start crying (if unresolved trauma)  
**- you start SMILING** 

I hope this helps at least one person, the way it helped me. Have a nice day, reader!

**Funny story**  
I was having lunch with my parents and I finally had the courage to bring up the topic of anxiety, now that I've learned to recognize it & deal with it. So I asked my dad, who is a very intelligent person, with a PhD, if he has anxiety perhaps, because he is kind of a negative person. This is what he said:   
\- Hey dad, do you think you have anxiety?  
\- Anxiety, what's that? Some modern problem of your generation?  
\- No, it's when you think of negative thoughts all the time. Like thinking about bad scenarios which might happen.  
\- No I don't have it. But yes I do think a lot about negative scenarios because I'm trying to prevent them. For example, I think of all the things that might go bad, so when they actually happen, I am prepared for them. Have you read Sun Tzu and ""The Art of War""? He said that preparation is most of the battle.

*\*queue me thinking how to tell him that this is exactly what anxiety is\**  
  
\- Well, dad, does that mean you're preparing for war in your head constantly, what kind of life is that?

*\*now he stopped to think, which he hasn't done in a long time, since he usually just spews out answers\**

\- Well, heh, maybe. 

By now I think he was embarrassed that anyone actually outwitted him in a sense, because he enjoys winning conversations. But also I think - no, I hope - that he reflected a bit on his life so far.",i cant go on

AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS!!!!!!

A Chicago hospital that tested antibodies found 30 percent of those tested had antibodies.

https://chicagocitywire.com/stories/530092711-roseland-hospital-phlebotomist-30-of-those-tested-have-coronavirus-antibody

Magnifying this percentage to the entire USA population, that would mean the death rate for the virus is 0.015 percent, about on par with the seasonal flu.

some really good news regarding asymptomatic spread! 

Per Wuhan Health Commission, the 300 asymptomatic carrier identified by large scale PCR testing between 15/05/2020 and 01/06/2020 have had their saliva and throat swab sample taken, and these samples have undergone isolation and incubation experiment at Chinese Academy of Science Wuhan. All samples have failed to result in incubation of live virus.

Experts believe the negative result of incubation experiments with the saliva and throat swab sample point at either minuscule viral load, or non-viable viral fragments unable to cause infection. Furthermore, samples from toothbrush, drinking cups, masks, towels and other personal effects have been taken from the 300 asymptomatic carriers, all have tested negative. On top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on PCR tests. All of these point at the conclusion that the asymptomatic carriers discovered in Wuhan are not infectious.

You are free to post a link you want help with or to add commentary on to help others understand it in a less anxious way, and now you can once again post links to good news as well as create good news collections (see the current stickied comment which includes some info on reassurance-seeking behavior). Our one requirement is that you should refrain from posting multiple times over a short period with good news links. If someone does this we will begin taking down their comments as spam.

Hi everyone,

It has been requested that we create a megathread for all of the events that have been happening with regards to the conflict in Ukraine. We decided that this is a good idea since so many people have been experiencing extreme anxiety because of it.

We have opted to have this thread be sorted by Best for the time being. To read and respond to the latest comments you can manually change the sort to New. The reason we‚Äôre doing this is because we want the most helpful and most grounded comments to float to the top to help as many people as possible keep their anxiety under control during this difficult time.

For those who want to talk with other anxiety sufferers in more of a live format, feel free to join our official Discord server with this invite link: [https://discord.com/invite/9sSCSe9](https://discord.com/invite/9sSCSe9). We have added a special channel to it called ""#ukrainediscussion"" so people can talk about what's happening and help each other.

7vn317,How I Beat my Anxiety Disorder and Advice on How to do so Yourself,Anxiety,1517921216.0,125,1905,"So if you‚Äôre reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I‚Äôve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don‚Äôt stop, I‚Äôve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I‚Äôve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I‚Äôve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I‚Äôve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I‚Äôve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I‚Äôve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I‚Äôm here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I‚Äôll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn‚Äôt really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you‚Äôre at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don‚Äôt discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you‚Äôre looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don‚Äôt feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don‚Äôt have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you‚Äôll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you‚Äôll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It‚Äôs going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it‚Äôll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you‚Äôre at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can‚Äôt calm down:

At this stage, you‚Äôre either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I‚Äôve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don‚Äôt try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you‚Äôll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn‚Äôt working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won‚Äôt stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you‚Äôve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you‚Äôll find it can‚Äôt. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you‚Äôre interested, the clinical term for this is ‚Äúarousal reappraisal.‚Äù It‚Äôs not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being ‚Äúengaged.‚Äù This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you‚Äôre at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it‚Äôs an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can‚Äôt sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you‚Äôll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they‚Äôre no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn‚Äôt feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you‚Äôll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you‚Äôre in a constant state of panic, they‚Äôre a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don‚Äôt recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I‚Äôve found it doesn‚Äôt really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you‚Äôre thinking or feeling. It‚Äôs a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don‚Äôt need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you‚Äôre getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It‚Äôs much easier to feel short of breath when you‚Äôre in a position that doesn‚Äôt let you breath easily. If you‚Äôre lying down, lay on your back. If you‚Äôre sitting, sit up straight.

Once you‚Äôve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you‚Äôre at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you‚Äôre not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here‚Äôs what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you‚Äôre going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what‚Äôs going on in your brain and body, the better you‚Äôll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they‚Äôll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you‚Äôre knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who‚Äôs been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you‚Äôre at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It‚Äôs aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It‚Äôs long, so I don‚Äôt think you need to do the first part, but there‚Äôs a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren‚Äôt worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as ‚Äúan incurable disease‚Äù in this book. He‚Äôs not a doctor or therapist and isn‚Äôt really knowledgeable on the subject, so I‚Äôd take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember, the point of these books isn‚Äôt to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you‚Äôll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you‚Äôre saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn‚Äôt know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who‚Äôs right for you, but this is a person you‚Äôll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they‚Äôll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you‚Äôre taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you‚Äôre down to two a day, try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It‚Äôs said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you‚Äôre anxious, but I‚Äôd like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you‚Äôre anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don‚Äôt dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you‚Äôre not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don‚Äôt need to do sprints whenever you run, but you‚Äôll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you‚Äôre having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it‚Äôs almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you‚Äôre just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won‚Äôt go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôve probably read the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts of your diet about a hundred times, but I‚Äôll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn‚Äôt entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I‚Äôll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won‚Äôt bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor‚Äôs discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn‚Äôt to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won‚Äôt change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn‚Äôt change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you‚Äôve been at these things for a while, you‚Äôll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you‚Äôre at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you‚Äôve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn‚Äôt manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you‚Äôre able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You‚Äôve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you‚Äôre still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here‚Äôs what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It‚Äôs easy to flounder or stop, and it‚Äôs okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don‚Äôt beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it‚Äôs part of what makes us human. And it‚Äôs okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you‚Äôve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I‚Äôd find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren‚Äôt meant to be fun**. If you‚Äôve got social anxiety and you‚Äôre challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it‚Äôll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you‚Äôll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it‚Äôll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you‚Äôre anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren‚Äôt I seeing my anxiety improve?‚Äù And the answer in this case is because this person wasn‚Äôt pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn‚Äôt expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It‚Äôs okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you‚Äôre seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you‚Äôre constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can‚Äôt find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true. 

**5.** Give it time. I‚Äôve said it before but it‚Äôs important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren‚Äôt the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.

I think it‚Äôs also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that‚Äôs kind of vague, I‚Äôll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you‚Äôre using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you‚Äôre someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself ‚Äúthat conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I‚Äôm a loser.‚Äù In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don‚Äôt know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn‚Äôt see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you‚Äôre not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you‚Äôre the one person out of the fifty who‚Äôs somehow figured out you‚Äôre losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn‚Äôt make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it‚Äôs absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you‚Äôre most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they‚Äôre both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you‚Äôll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You‚Äôre in the home stretch. This is it. You‚Äôre likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you‚Äôve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you‚Äôve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I‚Äôd ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you‚Äôve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it‚Äôs a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you‚Äôre almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you‚Äôll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don‚Äôt last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don‚Äôt really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you‚Äôve clearly demonstrated they work. All that‚Äôs left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you‚Äôll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you‚Äôre still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you‚Äôll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you‚Äôve had anxiety and use what you‚Äôve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you‚Äôre able to ease, the better you‚Äôll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would‚Äôve never been able to do.

There really isn‚Äôt much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you‚Äôve done so far and that there‚Äôs more to come.

Then finally‚Ä¶

No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That‚Äôs it. All the voices in your head telling you you‚Äôre not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don‚Äôt really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you‚Äôre energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you‚Äôve never had. It‚Äôs been a few months since you‚Äôve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you‚Äôre not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they‚Äôll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don‚Äôt have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you‚Äôll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.
_

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it‚Äôs telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it‚Äôs telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it‚Äôs telling you you‚Äôre going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that‚Äôs not true. If it‚Äôs telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don‚Äôt. If it‚Äôs telling you you‚Äôre losing your mind, remind yourself you‚Äôre not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it‚Äôs just anxiety and can‚Äôt do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You‚Äôve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don‚Äôt fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you‚Äôll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you‚Äôre doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you‚Äôve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it‚Äôll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn‚Äôt make it true. You‚Äôll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you‚Äôve been dreading isn‚Äôt half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You‚Äôll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you‚Äôre at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there‚Äôs anything you want me to expand upon. I‚Äôll try to respond to comments as best I can, but I work full time and don‚Äôt log into this account all that much, so I‚Äôm sorry if I don‚Äôt get to your comment as quickly as you‚Äôd like.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

Edit 3: Tossed another David Burns book (author of Feeling Good), **When Panic Attacks**, up in the book list. Thanks u/PM10inPAYPAL4LULZ. Also fixed some formatting issues.

Edit 4: Thanks again for all the support everyone. I'm glad people are still managing to find this post even though it was written almost a half year ago. I tossed a book recommended by u/andrelolzi up on the list in case anyone is looking for more resources.",no reason to live
1hhg8zf,An Open Letter to Anyone Struggling with Anxiety,Anxiety,1734568153.0,44,314,"There was a time in my life when anxiety ruled everything. I didn‚Äôt realize it at first; I just thought I was overthinking or being cautious. But it wasn‚Äôt that. It was waking up with a racing heart for no reason. It was avoiding calls or messages because I was scared of saying the wrong thing. It was replaying conversations in my head, trying to figure out if I messed up. It was lying in bed at night, physically exhausted but wide awake because my mind wouldn‚Äôt let me rest.

One moment that stands out for me was during a simple outing with friends. On the surface, I was smiling, laughing, and part of the group. But inside, it felt like I was on a battlefield‚Äîheart pounding, stomach churning, my mind constantly scanning the room for imaginary threats. No one around me knew. I was good at hiding it. Too good.

That‚Äôs the thing about anxiety‚Äîit‚Äôs invisible to everyone else. You can look fine, act fine, and even convince yourself you‚Äôre fine. But deep down, you‚Äôre carrying this weight that no one sees.

I remember the breaking point when I realized I couldn‚Äôt keep doing it alone. I was sitting in my car, too drained to even start the engine. I felt like I was stuck, but I also knew I didn‚Äôt want to live that way anymore. That moment didn‚Äôt fix everything, but it was the first time I acknowledged that what I was feeling wasn‚Äôt ‚Äújust how life is.‚Äù It was anxiety, and it was okay to admit it.

What I‚Äôve learned since then is this: anxiety doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre broken, and it doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre weak. It means you feel deeply, you care deeply, and sometimes your mind gets overwhelmed by it all. And that‚Äôs okay.

If you‚Äôre reading this and it feels familiar, please know you‚Äôre not alone. You don‚Äôt have to have it all figured out. Start small. Talk to someone you trust. Take a few deep breaths. Remind yourself that you‚Äôve made it through every anxious moment before this one, and you‚Äôll make it through this one, too.

Anxiety may always be a part of me, but it doesn‚Äôt define me. And it doesn‚Äôt define you, either. We‚Äôre all stronger than we think, even on the days when it feels like we‚Äôre barely holding on.

kzo87a,Reminder: Anxiety is suffering a simulation,Anxiety,1610948244.0,89,1132,"The suffering is real but you're suffering a simulation. It's not real. 

It's imaginary. 

It's all lies.

A part of your own mind made it up so it can't be an actual danger.

Actual dangers come from outside you.

Fear is meant to protect you from danger. 

But when fear overworks and causes life to become a living hell, it loses its whole point of existence.

Fear isn't meant to make you suffer endlessly, it is only meant to spur you to act in defense for a short while. If you keep looping in a fear cycle, fear has defeated its own purpose and should stop functioning.

There is a reasonable amount of light fear called Eustress that is justified and keeps you on your toes in a hostile environment. Anything more than that fear, anything that paralyses you, that hinders your full functioning, that prevents you from thinking straight, that prevents you from working according to a plan, is excess fear, and by definition has defeated its own purpose. Such fear has no point existing.

The higher number of times you affirm ""I'm actually safe except for XYZ"" the the faster you will feel better.

Remember, unless you're actually in an active war zone or shooting, you;re quite safe. Say it to yourself - ""I'm actually quite safe except for XYZ"".

Finally, remember: Hot flashes, crawling ants, crampy, pain, tingling, needles and other sensations, are _discomfort_, not danger. 

Discomfort is uncomfortable, but safe.

I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn‚Äôt spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn‚Äôt until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they‚Äôre retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn‚Äôt relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had ‚Äúother groups‚Äù of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they‚Äôd be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline.

15zyt2p,Life with anxiety is becoming unbearable,Anxiety,1692875076.0,4,1,"Hi everybody! This past few years were definitely the hardest on me. Ever since I turned 20 (now 24) I have only been confronted with situations that made my anxiety spiral. I try to challenge myself in life but by trying new things I actually just end up giving up on it beause it puts a terrible strain on me. For example wanting to do volontary work abroad, university studies, trying a new workplace or I tried to own a pet twice now but due to terrible anxious reactions I had to give them back after a few days. My anxiety manifests by having terrible stomach pain that makes me vomit and prevents me from sleeping days on end, it continues with panic attacks, diarrhea, weight loss and so on. Everytime I start to challenge myself I have to cancel that experience in order to lessen my anxiety again, but at the same time I miss on so many opportunities I desperately want to achieve. This pain is really becoming unbearable and I feel like I am putting a big strain on my family. Especially due to this recent event of adopting a kitten and now not being able to take care of it because my overthinking is turning me incredibly sick. I am aware that the act is terrible and I have put my family through unnecessary pain. I feel like a monster that is a huge burden to others and it‚Äòs really getting worse as time goes on.

zbiqkk,"Life is unbearable if you have no partner or friends, especially when you're physically sick on top of being depressed.",Anxiety,1670081095.0,4,51,"A month ago I experienced the first seizure I've ever had (a tonic clonic), and next to it being the most terrifying thing to ever happen in my life, I couldn't turn to anyone for any sort of comfort/support, because I'm alone. A couple days after that, I ended up catching Covid for the first time, and despite how badly it ravaged my already weakened mind/body, I still couldn't turn to anyone for any sort of comfort/support, because I'm alone. And in the same week that both of these awful things happened, my birthday also took place, but nobody noticed or cared, because I'm alone. For weeks afterwards I suffered terribly from long Covid and additional seizures of the focal variety, and throughout it all, I could only lay there, arms wrapped around my own body, whispering whatever little comfort I could give to myself, like a man freezing in the dark clinging to a tattered blanket for warmth. 

In the past, I used to have a couple people I spoke with online, but depression and the assortment of other mental illnesses I suffer from made me isolate myself completely. I've never had any IRL friends. 

Now, after everything that's happened to me this past month, I feel like I'm scrambling all at once to try and reach out to other people, and I'm glad to say that I've met a couple nice individuals this way, but they can only talk to me so much, and for most of the day I just sit completely alone in my room, lonely and scared like I've never been before. What's worse though, is how the more I need other people, the more that pushes them away. I don't want to be a buzzkill, or desperate, or clingy, or needy, but it's really hard not to be when you're in a crisis, yet regardless that doesn't make it any less repellent.   

If I were a normal person, unburdened by chronic depression, I could've at least had good friends and a loving partner to help me through this whole ordeal, but instead I've had to largely go through it alone. Because I've always been so depressed and neurotic, I haven't had the ability to form any sort of connections to other people. This right here is the worst trap life can set for you, since once a crisis hits you, especially of the medical variety, you have no one else other than yourself to see you through it, and let me tell you, that just isn't enough.

**TL;DR:** Depression destroys your ability to make meaningful connections with others, which in turn sets you up for a nightmarish future when you have to cope with major emergencies completely on your own.",life is unbearable

1fwec6b,I HAD ‚ÄúPermanent‚Äù Anxiety. Here‚Äôs my story and how it went away.,Anxiety,1728088848.0,53,145,"My goal here is to provide some hope and insight for others that are experiencing anxiety by sharing my journey. Maybe I can just help one person that is seeking answers like I was. This isn't some quick fix, but simply what my experience was over years and maybe you can gather some useful info. This post is mainly for people that have just recently stumbled into anxiety, specifically after a drug related event, but it may help anyone.

**ABOUT ME:**  
I had what I like to call an ‚Äúon-going panic attack‚Äù for about 2 years. It all started in my senior year of college. I had never really had ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù before as I would call it now. I would certainly get nervous and anxious about exams or fears, but it was fairly minor. I would overthink stuff and have always been a bit of a hypochondriac but I would never claimed myself as an anxious person.

That was until my first panic attack. There was a lot of stressors going on my life at the time (2021)‚Ä¶ Covid, graduating college, trying to figure out what to do with my life, dating, isolation, etc. I decided that with my time in isolation during Covid that I would try edibles to help with the tough times. I was always a bit of a goody two shoes and never did any sort of drugs, and would really only drink occasionally, but at this point I was desperate. The first few times I had a lot of fun but after some time during the year I decided to take an increased dosage as I felt as though I wasn‚Äôt really having as much fun as the first time I had done it. Went from taking a usual 10mg to then deciding to take 20mg. I started to feel extremely anxious, with an overwhelming sense of dread and fear as my whole body started freaking out. This was my first panic attack. I had been playing video games at the time and was desperate to go to the ER. Felt like I was almost in a time loop and lasted for hours and maybe at least what felt like that I can‚Äôt remember. Truly the worst experience of my entire life. Over the next few days, I still felt kinda bleh, but it was something that was in the past.

**THE INCIDENT:**  
A week goes by and I‚Äôm laying in bed on my phone, when all of a sudden I‚Äôm feeling a little anxious again until I‚Äôve worked myself up about this feeling to end up having another panic attack. This time was even scarier for me, as I didn‚Äôt know WHY this was happening. At least before I knew it was the weed and it was something that happens to people. This panic however, didn‚Äôt go away. There was nothing that I was consciously thinking about to make me feel this way, I was just in this loop of being anxious about being anxious.

Days go by where this panic doesn‚Äôt subside, my whole body is shaking, and I‚Äôm alone in my apartment horrified. I end up going to the ER and they ended up giving me some fast acting anxiety medication. This is when I finally had found some small bit of peace. This debilitating anxiety had gone from an 10 to about at 8. I was no longer shaking but I will still incredibly overwhelmed. Eventually I ended up moving back home and my journey to get back to normal started.

Now this anxiety wouldn‚Äôt just come and go. It was NON-STOP. From waking up in the morning to going to bed at night there was not a single moment of peace, it was always there‚Ä¶ but I couldn‚Äôt do anything about it this was just how I was now and it was driving me to intense depression. Usually at its worst in the morning, due to your high cortisol at that time, your body is sensitive to that increase.

**DESPERATE FOR A CURE:**  
Over this time I looked into all kinds of things to fix this, looking up my symptoms and finding stories on Reddit. Many of the things I read often made me feel worse, with people talking about how they got too high once and were forever changed. I was worried I was going to develop schizophrenia and start to lose my mind and be swept away into a mental hospital. THIS HOWEVER, I‚Äôve learned sadly a little too late is something that SO MANY PEOPLE exactly think and it‚Äôs just irrational thoughts that are incredibly common.

After so much research I was convinced that  there was something wrong with my body. This anxiety isn‚Äôt due to any sort of stress, it was something wrong with my body and I just had to find some fix for it. I tried therapy, improving my gut health, exercise, meditation, allergies, journaling, blood tests, X-rays, and all kinds of other health stuff. I was so afraid that this was going to be my life forever and I really wouldn‚Äôt be able to take it much longer. Medication was my last resort.

**MEDICATION:**  
I was finally put on Buspirone (10mg?) and after weeks I felt no change. DONT LET THAT MAKE YOU LOSE HOPE. I was convinced that even medication wouldn‚Äôt be able to help me, but after adding on some other medications and increasing the dosage‚Ä¶ it finally stopped after months of trial. This ISN'T me saying that medication fixes everything, but I just know that during my time I had seen so many posts and people talking about how it didn't work for them, so I am working to show the brighter side of things.

During this time I was unemployed and living at home, but at around this time of getting on medication I started a fun job at an Escape Room place. This job I loved, the people, the work, everything. It was truly what I needed. This in tandem with the medication helped me wake up one morning and realize that I hadn‚Äôt felt anxious in some time. After almost 2 years of constant unbearable fear, I found comfort finally. I

I ended up even finding someone at work that had gone through something similar, they had the exact same thoughts that they were going to develop schizophrenia and go crazy, but now we were both enjoying life again.

**LIFE NOW:**  
I look back now and find it so frustrating that when I was searching in fear on Reddit for someone to have lived through what I had gone through and made it out okay all I could find were horror stories. People saying that they have been like this for 15 years or something like that. THAT WAS THE WORST THING TO HEAR when trying to find hope‚Ä¶ like what the hell guys that is not what someone needs to be thinking about. I think it was difficult to find good stories because often times we‚Äôre searching our negative symptoms and people post on here with their problems, with solutions being scarce.

**THINGS THAT HELPED ME:**

* Exercise. Running was the worst thing in the world for me, but hey it really does help even a little bit.
* Meditation. Working on trying to ground yourself when feeling especially rough.
* Sleepcasts. Helped me get to sleep and distract myself. (I love Rainday Antiques by Headspace)
* Headspace. Super awesome meditation stuff and framing anxiety. There‚Äôs an app but also a lot of free stuff on YouTube.
* Medication. Don‚Äôt give up!
* Environment. Surround yourself with people that support you and understand. No one else could even perceive what I was going through, but this doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre alone. I just got a fun job and focused on living in the present for a bit.
* Therapy. Even just talking out how you feel with a family or friend. Or find someone online that is similar to you.

**CONCLUSION:**  
I think the panic was something that was coming from many stressors, but the weed was the last straw. I still do have a lot of anxiety about careers and what I‚Äôd like to do with my life, and I think that‚Äôs probably where most of the stress was as I had just graduated but was mostly subconscious. Medication and my environment helped me get to a point where I felt like myself again until I didn‚Äôt need it anymore. 

Hopefully this post can help just one person that is as lost as I once was and is searching for help. If you have similar stories or advice please share them! And if you have any questions, ask away! :)

**EDIT:** Thank you everyone for sharing! There is a lot more I could write but I wanted to say that I‚Äôm not trying to frame medication as a perfect solution. For me, it helped me get my body out of this state of debilitating anxiety, where I could then work on the things that were giving me anxiety (which at the time, I didn‚Äôt think were the problem I thought my body was just ruined because of the weed).

Also want to say that if you‚Äôre reading this post years from now, feel free to still ask any questions. I know it‚Äôs rough out there, stay strong!",life is unbearable

My mind has basically associated this with school, so most days are a struggle.  More than that, they're unbearable. I'm not even able to go to the toilet in school and crap because I don't plan on getting the piss taken out of me (Ik it sounds dumb but that's just what school is like.)

I literally have my GCSE's in a week (basically my final exams if you're not from the UK) and I cant fucking handle it. I don't know what to at this point. I want to blow my brains out. I know its psychological as well as physical but I cant control any of them. Sometimes I will go through a day of pure pain then get home and no longer need the toilet.

I'm not even sure if it is right to call it diarrhoea as there is no pain, its just an uncomfortable feeling and needing to crap obviously.

I would go to a doctor but I have some problems:

\-Its very embarrassing for me and If I were to explain everything I may have to talk about what my mental health has been like for the last few years and no one really knows about it and I'm not really comfortable talking about it.

\-The last time I went to the doctor for my anxiety in general (nearly 2 years ago) I went to this youth mental health centre were I did 3 sessions which was bullshit. I was treated like a child, my parents were there and they were not helpful. As a teenager a 1 on 1 therapy session were i'm actually treated like i'm not a 10 year old would be nice.

\-My parents simply don't understand ,despite them being supportive and my mum also having anxiety they just never understood what I was going through because our anxiety is different.

Quite a mess I know. But if anyone has had a similar experience can you tell me how you battled it.",life is unbearable

Outside of school, I enjoy TV, running, cooking, hiking, PC games, tech stuff and spending time with my wife. I feel bad for her because she has had a career right out of college and has been waiting for me to play catch up. I want to make it work for her but I don‚Äôt know if I can.

I‚Äôve always had an extremely regular menstrual cycle and I get my period every 28 days on the dot. And I‚Äôm still okay but maybe?. Also I‚Äôm super careful and never do anything without a condom but then I think about how no form o contraception it‚Äôs really 100% safe. It‚Äôs gotten really bad lately because I‚Äôve seen a couple of TikTok‚Äôs with stories of girls that didn‚Äôt know they were pregnant, and it got bad, specially because I weigh 100 pounds so I always thought okay no way I wouldn‚Äôt notice the change on weight and then read comments about super skinny girls that didn‚Äôt know and yeah let‚Äôs just say that send me down the rabbit hole. And it‚Äôs just so bad like I get my period normally and I just keep analyzing it because what if it isn‚Äôt really my period and it‚Äôs a different kind of bleeding and me thinking it is my period could avoid me noticing that I‚Äôm pregnant. And it‚Äôs just gotten so so bad I spend every day thinking about it, I‚Äôve had this problem since they start of my sexual life but like the last three months it‚Äôs gotten unbearable.",life is unbearable
1eruld2,What has helped you with morning anxiety/cortisol spike?,Anxiety,1723617069.0,54,52,"I struggle with anxiety, it varies across different seasons of my life, sometimes is manageable sometimes debilitating. 

It‚Äôs ALWAYS worst first thing in the morning, and during phases where I‚Äôm going through a  lot of stress, this becomes unbearable. I wake up, I have 1-2 seconds of peace and then every stressor in my life hits me like a tsunami, immediate extreme catastrophic thinking about every aspect of my life. It‚Äôs so overwhelming and feels like I‚Äôll never feel peace or happiness again. 

Sometimes I can‚Äôt get out of bed for hours. It‚Äôs just that impossible to face the day with the tornado of anxiety raging in my head. 

Has anyone found anything that has truly helped with this? Not looking to get back on SSRIs.. they definitely helped but had too many other negative side effects for me.

1i40wbg,Is it really just anxiety? 5 months of doctors and I feel like I‚Äôm dying. ,Anxiety,1737179203.0,23,10,"I had a stressful period of my life 5 months ago, but it wasn‚Äôt definitely the most, I‚Äôve went through worse throughout my life. 

It started with constant head pressure and dizziness, went to a neurologist and he said I have vertigo. Started some medications and vitamins, but symptoms kept getting worse. So far have seen a neurologist, two cardiologists, electrophysiologist, internal medicine doctor and gastroenterologist.

The 5 months, to say the least, have been hell, with my symptoms increasing and getting worse. They are;

1. Dizzy and lightheaded, sometimes to a point I think I‚Äôll faint or pass out. 

2. Short of breath, constantly, I feel like my body isn‚Äôt getting oxygen. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm suddenly about to stop breathing and my body gets cold or warm, feel like my brain isn‚Äôt getting oxygen. Especially back of my neck. 

3. Pain in my chest, arms, and legs (especially my left leg). There‚Äôs constant tightness, and what feels like burnings or stabbing nerve pain. Just all over body pain sometimes. 

4. Tinnitus. Constant ringing in my ears that makes me crazy. 

5. The fatigue is unbearable, feel like I can‚Äôt do anything. 

6. Disorientation and feeling like I‚Äôm not in control of my own body. 

7. Head pressure, sometimes accompanied by not headache, just sudden stabbing pains on sides of my head. 

8. Visual disturbances, slight double vision, trails, little dots.

9. Worst of all, palpitations sudden tachycardia episodes. I can literally be at rest, not thinking about anything, trying to fall asleep or just walking around the house and I can feel my heart race and it‚Äôll go upto 130-150. My electrophysiologist says I have IST and prescribed me a beta blocker but all it does it temporarily calm down my racing heart however I can still feel my heart beat 24/7. Pounding irregular heartbeat feels like I‚Äôm about to have a heart attack. Episodes are slowly becoming more frequent and when they happen I get super lightheaded, out of breathe, and start sweating. 

11. Hot flashes, body gets warm. Sweating.

12. Acid reflux and i needed to vomit a few times. 

13. My left leg is in constant pain, especially ankles and calves. Recently have seen swelling and can‚Äôt have doctors check it out other than them just looking at it and saying it‚Äôs cause of my weight. 

14. Fluctuating BP, sometimes low, sometimes high. 

Sometimes, out of nowhere, I‚Äôll get lightheaded with a pounding heart, my body will get tingly or have pain in my arms and legs, tightness in chest, literally feels like my body gets cold and is about to give out. These episodes are getting more frequent by the day. They come on out of nowhere. I‚Äôm travelling and have been happy(ish) and no matter how distracted I am, they‚Äôll just come out of nowhere and I genuinely feel like I‚Äôm dying. All the symptoms I mentioned will come at once. 

I‚Äôve been checked for iron, vitamin d and some other deficiencies and they all came back fine. Vitamin d was low a few months back but I was able to raise it with supplements. Did EKG, Echo, 24 hour Holter (when they said I have IST), stress test, brain MRI. All they‚Äôve found is a nerve loop in my brain, mild sinusitis which I went on antibiotics for, slightly raised cholesterol (doctor said it‚Äôll get better if I control diet and loose weight). I wanted to get a chest CT but doctor said as other tests are fine it‚Äôs not needed. 

I really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôm trying so many anxiety meds, nothing is working. I feel like I am bed ridden and waiting for death. I can‚Äôt function, can‚Äôt go out with friends, it‚Äôs ruining my marriage, and I just want to know what‚Äôs wrong with me. I‚Äôm constantly anxious something bad will happen to me suddenly.

I have been dealing with anxiety and self harm for three and a bit years now. I didn't ever think I would get a mental illness and the fact that the self harm evolved from that was even worse. It's so weird to think that this one thing happening in my life changed everything for me. It was all very sudden as well. I started locking myself away from friends and family, school became a hell hole and I was just alone with no idea what was going on with my head.

 I never got treatment. My mum tried to get some woman to help me, she came to our house and I swear to god...she was useless. I appreciate the fact that my mum wanted to help but there was apart of me that didn't want the help. I'd been living with this monster for so long, it started to feel like apart of my identity now. I was scared that I wasn't 'ill enough' or I would be wasting my time there, they wouldn't actually care and they were just greedy for money. Thinking about it now I understand how crazy that sounds of me to think like that but who could blame me from the state I was in?

My dad started to notice and became infuriated with me. It's difficult to explain to people who haven't gone through it, so that just made it worse. A few people that did stick around would pop up on my phone, and it was constant. They wanted to know how to help and even I didn't know what exactly was wrong with me. How can someone help if even you don't know what's wrong? I had completely lost touch with the real world.

Three years later, it's still extremely difficult but I persevere...because even though you may think it can't get better, it always does. I used to RAGE when ever anyone told me that but it's true.

To be honest, I don't think I will ever overcome my mental health, but I've been doing incredibly better thoughtout those three years. I've grown as a person, I've learnt new things, experienced new happy memories and I'm actually going to have a clean, joyful Christmas. This present time in my life is currently the happiest I've been since. The best part is that I'm thankful. Of course there are days when I think I wish it wasn't around but my mental health has taught me so much and made me stronger. I am thankful! So...THANK YOU ANXIETY! THANK YOU!

Remember to love your brain and your body. You only get one life, spend it the best way you possibly can. Give yourself breaks, if you are having a shitty day don't force yourself into anything, take a day off and pick yourself back up the following day. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't 'ill enough' to get treatment or that your mental health makes you 'worthless'. There is so much more to life than pain and suffering.
And most importantly... Congratulate yourself for getting past even a couple of days, a few weeks, a few months. It might not seem like much to you but every extra day you don't self harm, you are beating it! I believe in you all.
Learn to love your brain <3

1g526nv,Kid with Anxiety put on SSRI - TW self harm / suicidal ideations,Anxiety,1729092740.0,10,3,"Hi Reddit,

My almost 9YO was put on 25MG Zoloft back in August due to anxiety. He‚Äôs currently in talk therapy as well as seeing a psychiatrist monthly and his school counselor weekly. 

Last week he started vocalizing suicidal ideations to me and his school counselor. I got him into a therapy session and his psychiatrist right away as well as developing safety plans for home and school. His psychiatrist took him off Zoloft for the next two weeks as a break from the medication to see if Zoloft is the reason for the suicidal ideations. 

My son has never expressed thoughts of self harm, depression, etc. before getting on medication and now that it‚Äôs been a week since he‚Äôs been off Zoloft he said his ‚Äúdeath meter‚Äù is at 50% which is huge compared to the 100% he was at last week. I truly believe Zoloft is the reason for his suicidal ideations. 

Here‚Äôs my question, would ALL SSRIs give him this side effect? I‚Äôm terrified to try another medication, but I did see him flourish in areas of his life where he would normally be terrified to try whenever he started Zoloft. He was playing more with his peers, wanting to be on sports teams, participate in class, etc. he even told me he feels so much more confident this year in school than last year. 

We have an appointment next week with his psychiatrist, but I want to be informed in case she tries to give another SSRI.

I made a previous master-post on my long-term anxiety symptoms (which I overcame) where I went over the more bizarre, rarely spoken about, constant symptoms of long-term anxiety, and the feedback loop and it seemed to help a lot of people. I will link that one below, I recommend everyone read it first!

https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/10jcfko/longterm_anxiety_symptoms_i_had_from_someone_who/

A lot of you wanted to know how I overcame the DP/DR symptoms. I didn't realise that I had message requests on Reddit, and now I've got so many spanning across months ago that I can't find the time to get back to individually so I feel like its my duty to make this post and have it all in one place. Warning, this is a big post.

Lets go over some positives first as I find its always best to get off on a positive note, and to have something to look forward to or motivate others:

**1. DP/DR (Depersonalization and Derealization) is not and is never permenant, anyone who says so are catastrophizing and are probably biased or feeling that way due to their own condition not improving. These notions are not helpful and are also not true.**

**It will and can go away 100%, it is not something you have to 'deal' with or 'accept' for the rest of your life.**


**2. DP/DR does not work like a debt system e.g. the longer you are in DP/DR, the longer it is going to take you to get out of it (isn't true!). Everyone has the same chance of success in recovering from DP/DR, no matter how long or short you have been in that state.**
**3. DP/DR is not indicative or a sign of psychosis, and you will not become psychotic if you experience DP/DR.**


DP/DR is a **defense mechanism**, which attempts to make sure that only the body experiences pain or trauma and not the mind, by causing detachment. **Causes of DP/DR can be anxiety attacks, severe stress, health anxiety, drug induced (often from edibles or hallucinogens), traumatic first-hand or second-hand situations, abuse or any interpersonal trauma. Anyone of any age can experience DP/DR.**

.......................................................................

**What does DP/DR feel like?:**

- Everything feels (and looks) either too close or too far away from you, environments are distorted
- Everything feels flat or 2D, like it isn't quite real or tangible, others faces might feel unreal
- Can feel like the world is slipping away from you
- You might feel like you could fall over any second or fall through the floor
- Speech can feel slow/slurred, like your brain is struggling to find words
- Time can feel like its going too fast or too slow
- Feeling like you can observe yourself outside your body, everything feels disconnected, like you are very alone
- Your limbs can feel too small, too big, like you are taller or shorter than you actually are
- You might feel internally dizzy (like your mind is spinning but your vision isn't), woozy head feelings, fuzzy head
- More frequent feelings of nostalgia/dejavu
- Colours can feel more dull or distorted
- Feeling numb, like your memories are less tangible or unreal
- Hypochondria (Healthy Anxiety) is often a huge comorbidity with DP/DR

.......................................................................

**The Feedback Loop, what is it?**

Symptoms of DP/DR (as well as Anxiety/Health Anxiety) are often kept alive by or started something called the **Feedback Loop.** This is a loop that is constantly being fed into, which could have started from something as for example:

*You may be minding your own business one day and suddenly experience a Panic Attack, but you misread it as being something worse. You could think you're about to die, that you are having a heart attack because of the palpitations, that you could collapse any moment now, and then it goes... but you're on edge, what if it happens again? Do I have a heart condition? I think I'm dying, I think something is wrong. Everyday you are waking up and checking if you can feel palpitations, you're scared it will happen again, you're getting waves of dread, your mind is full of 'what ifs' over and over again every single day. Then one day, nothing feels real and you feel completely detached from reality and this scares you even more, you feel like you're slipping away, you're terrified and feel like you'll never be normal again. You're waking up everyday to check if everything still feels unreal, and it does, its not going away. Whats happening?*


This is the **Feedback Loop** example which led to DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms. What should've happened when you experienced for example: a Panic Attack, was that **you should've been able to realise it was a Panic Attack and been able to ground yourself or calm down during that situation and it would go away. This would eliminate the start of the Feedback Loop**, but instead by misreading the situation or not having the appropriate tools to manage it, you are now in fear, in high stress and feeling traumatised of the situation in fear it will happen again or that something worse is happening to you. This keeps the Loop alive and going.

**In preparation for the pain or fear you are about to anticipate happening, your body chose to disassociate from your mind and cause DP/DR in order to handle the stress and fear of what you're afraid of experiencing. DP/DR is attempting to save you from what could happen to you next, after being activated from something that already hurt you or traumatised you.**

Identifying the first source of your DP/DR can be particularly important in understanding and learning where your Feedback Loop started. **For some people it can even extend to as far as childhood, which can sometimes result in something known as DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)**. Once you have identified the source, this is the stepping stone into recovering from DP/DR.

Sources of DPDR can be: drug-induced from hallucinogens/edibles/bad trips/alcohol or other substances, anxiety attacks, depression, stress, medical trauma/childhood trauma/adulthood trauma/being a child of divorce, sexual assaults/CSA, PTSD, DID and more

Environments are also very important to be recognised as sources of DPDR e.g. stressful jobs, stressful/abusive relationships, difficult home life, being a full-time carer for family, difficult school life etc

.......................................................................

**So what's going to help me get better?**

There's a lot of resources and therapies available for DP/DR, such as Psychotherapy (talking therapies), CBT, DBT, EMDR and more.

But what is most important is that you are able to help yourself, as well as having professional support should you require it. **The thing that is going to get you better the most is you, and the tools you can develop to help you in time of need and in how you navigate the world and your trauma**. Some people (like me) may be able to recover from DP/DR without professional intervention or therapies, but it is always incredibly recommended if you have access or can afford it. **With DP/DR being highly trauma related, it is important to have a safe place to unload and traverse trauma with a professional**, as it can be tough to handle alone. **If you are concerned or suspect your DP/DR may be a result of DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder), professional help is absolutely necessary.**

Every person with DP/DR will be completely unique in their needs, what they can handle alone or what they need support with.

.......................................................................

**What can we do for ourselves?**

This is going to go over some self-practices and tools you can do in your own time to help yourself while actively experiencing DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms, and also how to reduce the chances of re-experiencing it when you are recovered.

**Staying Busy & Challenging Yourself:**

A big part of dissolving the Feedback Loop is by no longer feeding into it, and one way of doing this is by diverting our thoughts from the feelings of DP/DR or anxiety symptoms. **You want to find or make opportunities where you don't have time to think about DP/DR, or how it makes you feel, 'scanning' for feelings or signs of it, and to challenge those feelings instead.**
**DP/DR and anxiety is the perfect time to get busy and involved with life**, whether it is your hobbies, being with your friends and family, doing chores that need to be done, starting things you've always wanted to do. **It can feel scary, even terrifying to partake in these things when you feel unreal, like you're not present or that the world is slipping away, but you must keep pushing through**. Once you begin to challenge yourself and challenge those feelings of 'not feeling real' you begin to establish trust within yourself.

**Don't be disheartened that DP/DR or long-term anxiety symptoms do not disappear right away overnight, this is because your body hormonally, needs time to acclimate to low levels of stress and anxiety after having been kept at such high levels. If these hormones were to plummet immediately, the body wouldn't be able to cope, so it likes to decline it gently! So consider it like you are establishing trust:**

DP/DR has been in the drivers seat all this time, and you've been the passenger in the back. You're finally insisting on being in the driver's seat, but DP/DR insists on being the passenger right next to you. DP/DR is going to freak out in the passenger seat and take the wheel from you at times during some tough situations because its not sure you can navigate it on your own, and instead of letting it take the driver's seat again you need to say to it, 'Don't worry. I've got this'. and DP/DR will let go of the wheel. This in real life, would be an example of you handling the situation you are in and challenging yourself to face what makes you afraid (such as going outside in case you feel 'unreal').

**By doing this, you are establishing trust and are giving DP/DR the opportunity to know that you can handle the situation on your own. Eventually with time of practicing these things, DP/DR will get out of the car entirely and you can 'drive' all by yourself again and those feelings of DP/DR will be gone. You'll be able to live your life without things like anxiety or DP/DR dictacting where it takes you or how it makes you feel. You will have formed that trust that you can handle experiencing your pain, your fear, your trauma, your anxiety/stress etc. without the need of the defence mechanism of DP/DR. You will become the first line of defence!**

From personal experience this is what accelerated me to my complete recovery from DP/DR and long-term anxiety symptoms within 3-4 months of this practice after struggling for almost a year of non-stop DP/DR and anxiety symptoms. **I learned to empathise with my DP/DR's attempt at trying to keep me safe and acknowledged that it was only doing this in order to make me feel better, albeit in a scary and inconvenient way! So by learning techniques and also teaching myself not to be scared of DP/DR symptoms or my anxiety symptoms, I gave myself the opportunity to be the one in control and say ''Hey, I am totally capable of caring for myself now. Thank you for your help and what you tried to do for me'' to my DP/DR.**

By feeling afraid to participate in activities or doing things because you might feel unreal, or because the world feels distorted, you are allowing DP/DR to maintain control and are keeping DP/DR as an option

**Challenge yourself in incriments or in steps, and remember to reward yourself afterwards. Figure out what about DP/DR makes you afraid:**

**is it seeing people's faces? particularly friends or family?** - challenge yourself towards looking at faces, engaging with familiar faces (YouTubers, family, partners), if you can touch their face then touch it, grounding exercises where you say ''I can see two eyes, they are [insert colour], they have a [description] nose, do they have freckles? birth marks? do they have any smile lines? identify parts of their face and describe them'' this helps make them more tangible and less scary. Do little challenges before the bigger ones.

**is it going outside in case you feel unreal? woozy?** - challenge yourself towards small, short walks up and down your street, to eventually longer walks, acknowledge that you might be feeling dizzy/unreal but that you are safe, be kind & go home if you need it, try again another day, stay engaged with your hobbies/the outside world

**is it the feeling that you'll never be the same again? that you think its permenant? that you've ruined your life?** - The first thing you'll see if you look up 'can dpdr be permenant' is 'no!' and every other article will say no. There has never been an observed case of DPDR being permenant, and you won't be the first case of that happening. Its really important you do not entertain or engage with people who believe it is permenant, or that theirs is permenant because they are just people who are keeping their own DPDR alive with the negativity. I recommend writing positive affirmations or reading them, and engaging with positive stories of DPDR recovery and sticking with facts. **You have not ruined your life, and you will recover.**
**DPDR can make you feel afraid of lots of things, not just the ones I described above (but those are the most common).**

**Grounding Exercises:**
Grounding is a way to refocus and bring your attention back to the present and the world around you. This is can be used when experiencing fear or anxiety of your current DP/DR state, but is **most effective when you feel like it is 'coming on' or you are experiencing anxiety/stress that could lead to it.**

Grounding exercises can involve:

- Naming 5 things you can see, name 4 things you can touch and to touch them, naming 3 things you can hear and listening to them, what 2 things can you smell, 1 thing you can taste.
- Holding ice cubes, putting your hands in cold water, picking up or touching things and explaining how it feels (is it cold, warm, does it feel rough or soft), identifying their colours deeply
- Walks without music, tuning into the sounds of your steps, counting your steps, observing your surroundings on your walks, sitting in the grass and touching it.
- Mental anchoring by saying (in your head or quietly to yourself) your full name, your age, where you live, what street you live on, the date, where you are, what you're doing. Repeat this gently until you feel calm.
- Self-assurance phrases such as, ''You are okay'', ''Nothing can hurt me'', ''You will get through this'', ''I've done this once and I can do it again'' etc.

**My Example of How I Personally Recovered from DPDR:**

For me I dealt with a lot of wooziness/dizziness during my DP/DR and I felt terrified to do anything sitting up or standing because I'd have to acknowledge that dizzy feeling and the unreal-ness from DP/DR, so I would lie on my side all day while watching TV or playing games instead to cope. **I wanted to turn 'Oh god, no I'm dizzy and woozy and nothing feels real, I'm so scared' into 'Oh I'm dizzy and feel unreal today? Lets see what I can manage'.**

It started to become more of 'Let's get up! Lets engage with the same hobbies but lets sit up this time'. I'd do that for as long as I feel I could handle the dizzines and unreal sensations, and then I'd lie back down again. I rewarded myself and cared for myself with a technique that brought me comfort, while having succeeded in engaging with something that scared me or was difficult. Over time I'd start to sit up for longer, or I'd start to go outside on short walks (which was particularly hard as I'd feel more unreal outside than at home), and I would feel unreal, like everything was flat, like the world was slipping away but I did it.

Some days I would just cry or feel like I took steps back, that I'd be stuck forever but I kept going and I kept rewarding myself after those times with either little lie downs, eating things I really loved, engaging in self-care or watching familiar TV shows I know I loved. Over time I started to sit up a lot more, I started to stand more, I started to go out more and for much, much longer each time, I started to do all the things I loved again despite how I felt. **Don't get me wrong, I still felt unreal and dizzy but I wanted to stop being scared of it and to not let it stop me engaging with things I loved or wanted to do.**

**I stopped basing my days and thoughts on 'how good I'm feeling' and more so on 'how well can I manage today'.** That took away a lot of pressure for me, as I knew I would not feel better over night but I would learn to manage my days better, so focusing on that intrinsically helped me feel better. You'll want to learn how to manage bad days (whether DPDR days, anxious days, stressful days) because when you do, you'll become prepared for if you ever face any of those times again and you can conquer it!

One day after months of challenging myself, being more present, doing my hobbies, going outside (I remember this vividly) I was hugging my partner and I looked up at his face and I physically jumped, **he looked real. I started looking around everywhere and everything felt real, everything looked so colorful, the world didn't feel flat or distorted, everything felt 'real' and 'right' and when I touched my partner's face it felt so tangible and real.** I don't think I've ever cried that hard in my life from happiness, my DPDR was gone.

Everything probably felt like this for a while, but because I was so engrossed in engaging with the world around me and doing the things I loved I didn't actually realise it, because I was no longer questioning my reality or looking for signs of DP/DR. **So that one moment where I finally remembered to 'check' my reality, it made me realise everything felt real again and that I felt human again. And it never came back.**

When you feel ready, the key is to be kind to yourself as well as challenge yourself against your DPDR and how it makes you feel. By pushing through and engaging with the world around you bit by bit you will start to establish that trust, those tools, in convincing your body that you can handle yourself and that it no longer needs to detach with DPDR to keep you safe.

.......................................................................

**Some habits to get into, and some to get rid of:**

- **Cut out all alcohol and all drugs absolutely and completely, as well as caffeine & reduce or quit smoking.** All of these substances will have an effect on the hormones in your body, and can impede progress from DP/DR due to the sensations it can produce and will generally stress out the body, and mind-altering drugs like hallucinogens or Cannabis can worsen DP/DR greatly or keep it around. *If you are an addict or suffer from addictions, get in touch with services that can help you taper, detox or navigate potential sobriety, do not attempt any of this alone.*

- **Establish a normal bedtime routine**, ideally getting into bed at 9-10pm and waking up before 9am. Some people need more sleep than others so wake up at whatever time in the morning before 9am is best for you; getting adequate sleep will greatly improve the rate of which your DP/DR can dissolve as your mind will be most lucid, alert and prepared to handle potential stressors. **Sleeping too much or too little can greatly affect your brain and hormone regulation, and you need the best hormone regulation in order for the body to lower cortisol levels which leads to DP/DR symptoms rapidly improving.**

- **Stay hydrated and well-fed.** This is really typical mental health advice, but in general you will want to make sure you are hydrated and well-fed so the body has enough energy supply to handle stressors, anxiety and to ensure the mind is as lucid and energised as possible. You will need all the energy you can possibly get, and having these bases covered can really improve your symptoms.

- **Get checked for any Vitamin Deficiencies** as a lot of Vitamins we can be deficient in will greatly effect circadian rhythms, heart rhythms, the brain (deficiencies can cause brain fog, low motor skill function and poor hormone regulation). **Making sure we have healthy, functioning foundations to work off of greatly supports mental function and our ability to take on new information and learn new things (such as therapeutic tools and treatment).**

- **Identify your stressors and reduce them, identify your triggers and navigate them.** Cortisol levels increase with stress (from stressors) and anxiety, when we are faced with high levels of cortisol for extended periods of time, the body can produce bizzare and scary symptoms (which are harmless).

Please feel free to ask me any questions if you have any! I'd recommend you leave them as a comment on this thread, as it can help other readers find the answers to the question you might've already asked me!",cutting myself
mhlufw,Please stop medication shaming,Anxiety,1617244920.0,345,934,"This is a PSA to the anxiety community. It's bad enough when you get it from people who don't even understand the concept of having anxiety, it's 10x worse when it comes from people within the community who also suffer from anxiety disorders.

Goddamn I get it left and right from fellow anxiety sufferers the very moment I mention that I'm on medication. It always turns into preaching. You may think you're helping, but you're really not. There are many different preachy topics people get into, but the main sentiments are ""oh, you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you."" Or ""oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30"" 

Fuck off. I experienced something traumatic. I was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. Therapy alone did not cut it. Going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either, which some people smugly like to suggest. I was in so much fear that I literally disassociated from myself. Meds kept me from being hospitalized.

I got shit from my doctor and people on here (not this sub specifically I haven't commented here before). You're going to die horribly for being on those meds! be afraid! be scared! feel ashamed!

Well guess what, I found a fantastic therapist who completely understands my plight. In one of our first sessions when I told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped, she IMMEDIATELY agreed and was like ""oh yep definitely. It's too powerful of a reaction/feeling. I know."" She herself experienced some trauma from her past, and she told me that when she stopped drinking and was on an anti-anxiety med for her panic disorder someone smugly told her ""oh so you dropped one addiction for another."" Oh boy did I have some shared anger with her over that. 

I really don't care to hear anyone's ""help"" or ""advice"" when it comes to my choice to take medications. I don't want your shaming, or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication, good for you. I don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. There's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and I fucking hate it. OOooOOoo they're so bad for you! Guess what's also bad for me? Not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. Hm. Wonder which is worse?

I would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say I should do. My doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until I said essentially that to her, and then she finally laid off. 

And addiction doesn't happen to everybody. I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. They sure didn't have anything to say to that. 

So bottom line, stop shaming people who choose medications, if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals, go do it somewhere else. Not everyone is that lucky. Yes I'm bitter.

edit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that I take **benzos,** which are apparently a big no-no to many people. I'm not sure if I would have had the same experience from people if I were taking non-benzos. People really love to scare me about those. But they saved my life and continue to do so, so, *shrug.*",cutting myself

7vn317,How I Beat my Anxiety Disorder and Advice on How to do so Yourself,Anxiety,1517921216.0,125,1909,"So if you‚Äôre reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I‚Äôve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don‚Äôt stop, I‚Äôve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I‚Äôve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I‚Äôve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I‚Äôve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I‚Äôve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I‚Äôve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I‚Äôm here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I‚Äôll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn‚Äôt really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you‚Äôre at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don‚Äôt discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you‚Äôre looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don‚Äôt feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don‚Äôt have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you‚Äôll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you‚Äôll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It‚Äôs going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it‚Äôll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you‚Äôre at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can‚Äôt calm down:

At this stage, you‚Äôre either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I‚Äôve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don‚Äôt try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you‚Äôll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn‚Äôt working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won‚Äôt stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you‚Äôve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you‚Äôll find it can‚Äôt. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you‚Äôre interested, the clinical term for this is ‚Äúarousal reappraisal.‚Äù It‚Äôs not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being ‚Äúengaged.‚Äù This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you‚Äôre at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it‚Äôs an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can‚Äôt sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you‚Äôll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they‚Äôre no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn‚Äôt feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you‚Äôll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you‚Äôre in a constant state of panic, they‚Äôre a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don‚Äôt recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I‚Äôve found it doesn‚Äôt really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you‚Äôre thinking or feeling. It‚Äôs a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don‚Äôt need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you‚Äôre getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It‚Äôs much easier to feel short of breath when you‚Äôre in a position that doesn‚Äôt let you breath easily. If you‚Äôre lying down, lay on your back. If you‚Äôre sitting, sit up straight.

Once you‚Äôve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you‚Äôre at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you‚Äôre not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here‚Äôs what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you‚Äôre going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what‚Äôs going on in your brain and body, the better you‚Äôll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they‚Äôll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you‚Äôre knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who‚Äôs been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you‚Äôre at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It‚Äôs aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It‚Äôs long, so I don‚Äôt think you need to do the first part, but there‚Äôs a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren‚Äôt worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as ‚Äúan incurable disease‚Äù in this book. He‚Äôs not a doctor or therapist and isn‚Äôt really knowledgeable on the subject, so I‚Äôd take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember, the point of these books isn‚Äôt to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you‚Äôll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you‚Äôre saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn‚Äôt know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who‚Äôs right for you, but this is a person you‚Äôll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they‚Äôll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you‚Äôre taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you‚Äôre down to two a day, try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It‚Äôs said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you‚Äôre anxious, but I‚Äôd like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you‚Äôre anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don‚Äôt dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you‚Äôre not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don‚Äôt need to do sprints whenever you run, but you‚Äôll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you‚Äôre having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it‚Äôs almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you‚Äôre just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won‚Äôt go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôve probably read the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts of your diet about a hundred times, but I‚Äôll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn‚Äôt entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I‚Äôll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won‚Äôt bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor‚Äôs discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn‚Äôt to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won‚Äôt change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn‚Äôt change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you‚Äôve been at these things for a while, you‚Äôll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you‚Äôre at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you‚Äôve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn‚Äôt manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you‚Äôre able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You‚Äôve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you‚Äôre still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here‚Äôs what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It‚Äôs easy to flounder or stop, and it‚Äôs okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don‚Äôt beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it‚Äôs part of what makes us human. And it‚Äôs okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you‚Äôve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I‚Äôd find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren‚Äôt meant to be fun**. If you‚Äôve got social anxiety and you‚Äôre challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it‚Äôll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you‚Äôll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it‚Äôll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you‚Äôre anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren‚Äôt I seeing my anxiety improve?‚Äù And the answer in this case is because this person wasn‚Äôt pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn‚Äôt expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It‚Äôs okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you‚Äôre seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you‚Äôre constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can‚Äôt find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true. 

**5.** Give it time. I‚Äôve said it before but it‚Äôs important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren‚Äôt the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.

I think it‚Äôs also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that‚Äôs kind of vague, I‚Äôll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you‚Äôre using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you‚Äôre someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself ‚Äúthat conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I‚Äôm a loser.‚Äù In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don‚Äôt know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn‚Äôt see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you‚Äôre not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you‚Äôre the one person out of the fifty who‚Äôs somehow figured out you‚Äôre losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn‚Äôt make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it‚Äôs absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you‚Äôre most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they‚Äôre both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you‚Äôll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You‚Äôre in the home stretch. This is it. You‚Äôre likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you‚Äôve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you‚Äôve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I‚Äôd ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you‚Äôve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it‚Äôs a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you‚Äôre almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you‚Äôll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don‚Äôt last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don‚Äôt really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you‚Äôve clearly demonstrated they work. All that‚Äôs left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you‚Äôll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you‚Äôre still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you‚Äôll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you‚Äôve had anxiety and use what you‚Äôve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you‚Äôre able to ease, the better you‚Äôll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would‚Äôve never been able to do.

There really isn‚Äôt much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you‚Äôve done so far and that there‚Äôs more to come.

Then finally‚Ä¶

No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That‚Äôs it. All the voices in your head telling you you‚Äôre not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don‚Äôt really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you‚Äôre energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you‚Äôve never had. It‚Äôs been a few months since you‚Äôve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you‚Äôre not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they‚Äôll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don‚Äôt have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you‚Äôll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.
_

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it‚Äôs telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it‚Äôs telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it‚Äôs telling you you‚Äôre going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that‚Äôs not true. If it‚Äôs telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don‚Äôt. If it‚Äôs telling you you‚Äôre losing your mind, remind yourself you‚Äôre not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it‚Äôs just anxiety and can‚Äôt do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You‚Äôve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don‚Äôt fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you‚Äôll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you‚Äôre doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you‚Äôve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it‚Äôll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn‚Äôt make it true. You‚Äôll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you‚Äôve been dreading isn‚Äôt half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You‚Äôll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you‚Äôre at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there‚Äôs anything you want me to expand upon. I‚Äôll try to respond to comments as best I can, but I work full time and don‚Äôt log into this account all that much, so I‚Äôm sorry if I don‚Äôt get to your comment as quickly as you‚Äôd like.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

Edit 3: Tossed another David Burns book (author of Feeling Good), **When Panic Attacks**, up in the book list. Thanks u/PM10inPAYPAL4LULZ. Also fixed some formatting issues.

Edit 4: Thanks again for all the support everyone. I'm glad people are still managing to find this post even though it was written almost a half year ago. I tossed a book recommended by u/andrelolzi up on the list in case anyone is looking for more resources.",cutting myself

-Please consider cutting out or drastically limiting sugar intake. It is hard, but my anxiety is much more manageable. The only exception I give myself is celebrations, specifically those with others. Enjoy birthday cake, pumpkin pie at holiday gatherings, hard candies on Christmas morning, and the like.
-Please do the same with caffeine. I did a ‚Äústep down‚Äù plan. For one week I drank half of what I did the week prior until it was gone. If you drink coffee or tea, start mixing with half decaf. The goal is to gradually step down to no caffeine.
-Please consider working up to one hour of moderately intense exercise a day, preferably outside, preferably first thing in the morning. The most important aspect is the exercise. When I was first starting this journey, I would just get up and watch a show I loved while I marched in place, pumping my arms. Morning and outside components will help your sleep.
-Consider adopting an anti-inflammatory diet. For me that means: no refined grains, no nightshades, no dairy, no gluten, and no beef or pork (especially processed meats like hot dogs). Anti-inflammatory diets are an elimination process, and there are many different methods. 

Since doing these things, my anxiety attacks have gone from severe and long-lasting, to occasional and easier to beat. Thank you to everyone in this subreddit!

The bright side to my mental illness: it give me the most creative ideas in horror. I feel like I've gone actually mad.

1guvjg3,BPD vs anxious attachment style,mentalillness,1732017715.0,1,2,"BPD vs anxious attachment style

I have been misdiagnosed multiple times since I was 14. Started off as catatonic schizophrenia, then bipolar disorder type II, then depressive episode (after my attempt), then BPD, and now MDD with psychotic features.

The diagnosis I resonated the most with was BPD, however I am struggling to trust any psychiatrist as my symptoms can be subjective. 

These are things I have realized about myself over the years:

1) I have very black and white thinking when it comes to someone‚Äôs changes in behavior. If they are treating me well, I will assume they love me. If they do one wrong thing, I forget all the good and assume they hate me. 

2) I split. When someone does me wrong, I can go from putting them on the highest pedestal to absolutely hating them and thinking they‚Äôre the worst person I‚Äôve ever encountered. 

3) I have an addictive and reckless personality. I can get very addicted to substances, feelings, people, or places. And once that thing leaves me or it stops existing in my life anymore, I can feel an intense void. 

4) I don‚Äôt know who I am without the people I love around me. I don‚Äôt have an identity. My personality is made up of everyone‚Äôs personality‚Äôs around me.

5) I often mirror people to get them to like me more. I can mirror someone‚Äôs humor or their enthusiasm, or even their depression or anxious-tendencies. I can become introverted when around introverts and an extrovert around extroverts. 

6) when I am feeling low, I have the strongest urge to hurt myself because it is easier for me to feel physical pain than the mental pain I am feeling in that moment. 

7) I am terribly afraid of being abandoned, by my friends, my loved ones, and my partner. I go to extreme lengths even lying to keep them from leaving me - even if it is all made up and in my head. 

8) I have an obsession with numbers. For example, I absolutely hate the number 3. If I see that my message was delivered to someone 33 minutes ago, I will hold my breath as long as I can while refreshing. If the number does not change to 34 by the time I exhale, I am convinced they will abandon me or some other delusion. 

This even applies to my boss at work for example, if she is in a bad mood I‚Äôll assume I‚Äôm doing terrible and I am going to get fired. 

It‚Äôs really affecting me negatively and my relationships negatively. ",anxious

1i97mo5,Sisyphus in a Psych Ward - a Cruel Reminder of Hopelessness,mentalillness,1737756988.0,2,2,"
I've been thinking a lot about something that happened when I was in Prairie St. John's a while ago, and I feel like it‚Äôs important to share. We had this therapist who constantly brought up the myth of Sisyphus. For those who don‚Äôt know, Sisyphus was condemned by the gods to roll a massive boulder up a hill, only for it to roll back down every time he neared the top, forcing him to start over again‚Ä¶ forever. The story is often used to symbolize an endless, pointless struggle, where no matter how hard you try, you‚Äôll never reach any resolution or peace.

The therapist repeatedly used the story in a way that just emphasized despair. It wasn‚Äôt about finding purpose in our struggles‚Äîit was about reinforcing the idea that we were stuck in a never-ending cycle, with no hope of progress, no hope of escape.

What made it even worse was the environment we were in. The staff already had this undercurrent of malevolence toward patients. We were seen as weak, as broken, as a problem to be managed rather than people to be helped. The Sisyphus story didn‚Äôt provide any sense of solidarity or hope, it just crushed what little spirit we had left. It‚Äôs cruel to subject patients to that kind of mindset, especially when you‚Äôre already in a vulnerable place, trying to make sense of your own suffering and fighting for some sense of dignity.

The therapist‚Äôs approach didn‚Äôt foster healing. It reinforced the feeling that we were all just doomed to suffer endlessly, that no matter how hard we fought or how much we struggled, it would never make a difference. I can‚Äôt even explain how damaging that is when you‚Äôre already struggling with mental health issues. We needed something uplifting, something that showed us that there was hope, not a myth that crushed us further into despair.

It just felt like a constant reminder that we were stuck in an endless loop of hopelessness, with no way out.

Has anyone else had similar experiences with therapists or staff in mental health settings where the approach felt more harmful than helpful?

1ht2nmz,"I'm so frustrated and hopeless about insomnia, ADHD and treatment resistant depression today. ",mentalillness,1735953273.0,3,3,"I have PTSD, treatment resistant depression, combined type ADHD, autism, and ARFID; and (while it's not a mental illness) I'm pretty sure I also have a circadian rhythm sleep disorder. It all adds up together to an immense amount of frustration. 

I have 3 separate needs from mental health treatment: to be able to focus, to be able to sleep, and to be less depressed. And apparently that's a lot to ask for. I don't blame all of the doctors I've seen that I'm still trying to figure that shit out, but I really hate it.

I'm just... Tired. I'm tired of constantly adjusting depression meds when nothing works. I'm tired of being unable to sleep, because for some reason nothing works for that either. I'm still trying to adjust my Adderall dose so that it actually works, so on top of all that, I can't focus or stay organized or do anything, including stuff that I need to do. 

I've tried everything possible for insomnia and anxiety that isn't a controlled substance; my psychiatrist won't prescribe more than 1 controlled substance at a time, but I'm not sure that z-drugs are ""every night"" sorts of options anyway. I even did a full round of CBT-I, which I paid for out of pocket so that I wouldn't have to take a break from trauma therapy. I've gotten less than 5 hours of sleep every night this week. This wasn't an issue at all until I developed PTSD 4 years ago, and hasn't worsened with Adderall. 

For depression, I feel like I've tried everything that isn't an MAOI (which I can't take, because ARFID). Antidepressants, off-label antipsychotics, lithium, whatever else. I even had 58 sessions of electroconvulsive therapy over about 18 months in 2015-2016. My insurance doesn't cover Spravato. Gotta love it. 

I've been trying to figure out ADHD stuff for months now. I had to stop taking Concerta last year because it made me extremely dehydrated and caused a lot of issues with muscle tension, but it *worked.* I could focus. I could be organized. I was calm. 

I've been trying to figure out Adderall for 4 months, and we just increased my dose to 15mg. Except my resting heart rate was already at 115 bpm, and my psychiatric NP didn't want to prescribe a beta blocker, so I need to talk to my PCP, who will hopefully agree to do it without additional cardiac testing. She also lowered my Wellbutrin XL dose from 300mg to 150mg, to try and handle the heart rate thing, but I'm not too confident that it'll work out great. So that's frustrating, because I'm not too keen on feeling more depressed and still struggling with Adderall side effects. 

Medical stuff triggers me. I know that I'm triggered, because I feel like I'm always going to be a miserable insomniac who can't focus enough to do anything that he actually cares about.

I've only been diagnosed with PTSD for 3 years, and ADHD for 2. So you'd think that I'd feel hopeful about using this information to help with the depression, but right now I don't. I just feel frustrated. This sucks. 

I also did EMDR therapy yesterday about issues with medical neglect, so that probably isn't helping things. Ugh. 

I dunno if anyone is actually gonna read all of this. But it just sucks so much to be struggling with all of these different psych issues. ",hopeless

My husband recently lost his job, he hurt his back and missed a lot of work, even though he had doctors notes and whatnot. So obviously he was very frustrated with that. And then he thought of himself as a failure the more we were suffering financially.
I tried my best to stay positive, though I was very scared at first. But didn't blame him at all. It was a few weeks of applying and interviews, but he was finally hired for a new job yesterday. So thankful for it.
He is a night owl, always has been. He went out last night to hang out with some friends. Early this morning I woke up for work and talked to him for a bit. He had been drinking and I knew something was wrong. 
He suddenly started crying and told me he was debating on >!suicide!< the last couple of weeks.
I felt so bad. I knew he was struggling but I didn't realize it was that bad.
So I stayed home from work and talked to him and finally got him to sleep. He was upset because this new job doesnt pay as well as the last and he hates himself at the thought of not being hired at other places because he has a felony.
He knew I have been dealing with health problems of mine own and missing more work as well. Which didn't help our financial situation, but we have been doing our best and still able to figure things out for the most part.
 I suffer from depression and OCD, and he feels bad to talk about his stuff with me because he doesn't want to bother it with me since he feels I deal with enough of my own stuff. 
I tell him I still want him to talk to me whenever he's suffering and we can talk and help each other. He feels like it doesn't deserve it.
I've already been in the middle of switching jobs. I was going to wait until he got more settled into his new one. 
But to be honest, after not going into work today, I'm pretty sure I've reached the point where they're most likely going to fire me.
But I couldn't just leave my husband home alone with our son feeling like that.
Part of me knows everything will turn out alright. But the other part of me thinks that everything is going to fall apart.",overwhelmed

Today

by Craig Braquet,¬†Organizer

I sincerely hope this message finds you well and surrounded by your loved ones. I wish I could share the same sentiment about my partner, Ethan, but it‚Äôs painful to say that he is still trapped in prison. Instead of receiving the essential care he requires in a psychiatric facility, he languishes without the support that could truly make a difference in his life.  
  
Each day brings more heartache as I learn that he continues to be denied his psychiatric medications. The thought of him enduring this torment without proper treatment is unbearable; his mental health deteriorates further, and his life hangs in the balance with each passing moment.  
  
It crushes me to think of the anguish he faces every day. The prison psychiatrist only seems to ask the most basic and terrifying questions, which only deepens Ethan's fear of expressing his true feelings. He‚Äôs caught in a constant cycle of dread, terrified of being sent to the HOLE. This ongoing threat makes it impossible for him to open up and share what he is truly experiencing. When family members try to reach him, they worry about which version of Ethan they‚Äôll encounter‚Äîwhether he‚Äôll be the loving partner, the combative Anthony, or the fiercely defensive Tony.  
  
I feel utterly powerless and overwhelmed by the helplessness of this situation. I am reaching out because I desperately need support and understanding. Please keep Ethan in your thoughts, and if there's any way you can assist us‚Äîany advice or help it would mean the world to us during this unbearably difficult time.  
  
We have retained legal representation from Kyle D. Curson, Attorney at Law, in hopes of expediting Ethan's case as a medical emergency. With Kyle's help, we are striving to get him moved from prison into a Psychiatric Hospital where he can receive the critical medical care he so direly needs. Each time his family speaks with him, they express their growing concern as he sounds more and more hopeless, sinking deeper into despair. He feels as though he has no chance for better treatment, and that thought weighs heavily on my heart. Thank you for your compassion and understanding; it truly means everything to me.  
  
In the first week of this GoFundMe we have raised $1140. While helpful, we need to raise a lot more to be able to make things happen quickly enough to help Ethan during this very dangerous time in his health journey. Please share this with ANYONE you believe could help us, and if you can find it in your heart to make another donation Ethan and I would be eternally grateful.",overwhelmed

I made a friend who has ADHD. When I talk to him in a regular manner it goes good. Also when I behave seriously. I do joke with him too and he laughs.

The thing is I also have mental problems and quite possibly ADHD! Sometimes I touch a lot, get hyper, talk a lot, and act a lot less than my age. I'm a 28M. I even forgot my keys in my car nearly ten times. Sometimes he tells me that I overwhelm him. He doesn't tell me everything though. But today he said that I overwhelm him. A lot of times when I start acting like how I just described, he seems to not like it, and starts showing and sayings statements of how he dislikes it. He also says he feels I'm mocking him. I never am though. 

Sometimes I feel like he's gaslighting)manipulating me because he says he doesn't like how I'm acting, well not that explicitly and when I ask why he doesn't answer completely. Like how he said he gets over whelmed and that he feels like I mock him because sometimes he jokes and is laughy. I told him I'm not mocking him though, more than once.

Everything about my life and the events that have transpired in it, my appearance specifically my face, my job and current stressers have me just down all the time. Mixed with the fact that my brain doesn't shut off all the bad things when I'm not pre occupied mentally. I just can't help but think of every bad thing or thing that makes me sad or angry . It's exhausting, especially at work where I'm worked like a horse but it takes no mental capacity to do. 
I have extreme hatred for myself. My face and everything about it is ugly. I'm a male but have a small and narrow face. Recessed fave with a weak jaw bad teeth and lips. I'm ugly as all get out. 
My personality isn't good. I'm boring and get angry way to easy . I have no interests or passions in life aside from MTG, which I haven't played much bc I just don't care much anymore. I get depressed easily. I don't go out bc I envy literally every male that passes for being average or attractive while I'm stuck as this monster .
On top of all this I just have this inability to be happy. I'm stuck at a job I don't want that (boring long day factory bs. 120 degrees daily qnd miserable). I have 2 ex that I have children with. One won't stop putting my oldest in danger. The other I haven't seen in a year bc my ex won't let me see him, court for the first 6 months didn't favor me. We were supposed to make a deal and her offer was unreasonable . I couldn't come up with a counter offer and then I've been to broke to afford a lawyer for 8 months since then bc I have to put my resources into the other child that's actually jn danger. I get i have to but I cry literally every day missing my youngest boy and is probably the worst and most depressing thing to me right now. He doesn't even remember me probably and last time I saw him he could barely walk and now a year later he can probably talk in sentences. I dont know what he looks like anymore and I wanna just scream and cry all at the same time. He means everything to me and my heart breaks every day . 
My current relationship is falling a part. Lots of fighting bc I'm to insecure and say it. Don't get out. She also has lots of anger issues and us both having mental issues doesn't work.
I'm so broke and the world is so hard to make it in right now that with the two of us both working 40 hour jobs we can't get out of my frigging grandma and moms house . Don't get me started on my issues with my grandma and mom. I'll be here all day. 
I dont know what to do to get out of this hole. I feel like I am just doomed to never be happy or content.  Especially the stuff with my ugly face and even more, the stuff with my son if I don't see him soon.

I imagined my parents finding out, and the disappointment on their faces. I imagined work finding out. I imagined the new life I had worked so hard to create, just being washed away.

Collapsing every time I tried to stand, my face red and flushed. My mouth dry as a bone. Hallucinating, confused, crying, begging with unknown entities. Bargaining with the universe- please don't let me need to go to hospital. I can't cope with the embarrassment. I can't do this. 

For whatever reason, I made it through. I finally slept after two nights of this, and I've settled down a lot.

I keep needing constant hydration, too.

I was too depressed to go walk the 3 blocks to the pharmacy to go pick up my meds, so I have been out for the month of March. Today I gathered the courage to make this dreadful trip! 

What I hate about my mental illness: not being able to function, life ruined because I can't envision a happy future. 

The bright side to my mental illness: it give me the most creative ideas in horror. I feel like I've gone actually mad. One moment I'm manically depressed, crying my eyes out, then the next I get such a good idea that i'm laughing like an evil genius. I came up with the most beautiful book idea in the world! I just need to activate my ADHD then I can write this book in one sitting. But it's so good, I don't want to escape this world that I built, I feel like I can write this book no matter my mental health weather. 

I just wanted to make this post because a lot of friends on here have been really concerned for me so I just wanted to say: I'm alright, I'm coping, I have a psych appointment friday. please feel free to ignore this!",i cant cope
1jljdhc,I am sick and tired of being me,mentalillness,1743124616.0,4,5,"I am so sick of being suicidal all the time, I wish I could feel anything besides sad and overwhelmed for any substantial amount of time. I get little sparks of happiness for maybe an hour if I'm lucky and then it's just SAD, SO SAD all the freaking time and I can't take it anymore, it's like living with the most depressing person on the planet except it's ME so I can never escape them! I'm sick of myself! Why can't I just chill out! Why does everything have to be the end of the world! 

Today I applied for a summer job and my cursed stupid freaking brain went ""If I have to go there I will kill myself"" and when I considered the opposite, ""If I don't get this job I will kill myself"" well it can't be BOTH! But my stupid brain can't handle ANYTHING! There's no winning! I just never feel okay!! And I can't live like this, it makes me lash out at my friends just to freaking feel something and I can't keep doing this. I've started drinking to cope with the sadness because it's just so heavy and so much and when I'm drunk it goes away until I sober up. I used to use weed but it became prohibitively expensive and I'm too much of a useless depressed lump to get a job. 

I know!!! You can't bully yourself into getting better I know I know I know but listen to me I have been kind and gentle to myself most of the time for years and things aren't getting better. They're not! I can cope fine enough to survive but I'm just distracting myself from the sadness all the time, I wish the depression was a physical mass I could remove, or God at least a visible disability so I can point at that when I have to explain why I'm unemployed instead of trying to dance around the subject or pick the most socially acceptable way to say ""I am actively choosing not to kill myself every single day right now and work would push me over the edge"" because people neither like that much nor really BELIEVE you about it.

I have been taking Xanax (alprazolam) for about 8 years now. no consistent dosage, usually 0.5mg whenever I have a panic attack. sometimes once a day, sometimes 3 times a day. at times I would take 1mg but never more, which I believe is a relatively small dosage. 

for the past 3 weeks I've been suffering from severe panic attacks, chest pains, difficulty breathing, heart palpitations etc due to loads of family and relationship stress. I have subsequently been taking 1mg about 3 times a day and the moment it starts wearing off, the physical symptoms return and I need to re-dose.  it feels like I'm going to have a heart attack, the left side of my body goes numb, my sinuses close up, and I am out of breath if I don't take it. I don't know what to do anymore and can't take off work. today I took 1mg of Xanax and 5mg of diazepam and I guess the fear and anxiety are exacerbated as I don't want to OD. I don't know what to do and I would appreciate any advice. 

my diet has gone down the drain, my motivation is at an all time low and I cant cope with the physical symptoms of anxiety/panic attacks anymore. 

has anyone else experienced this and are there any professionals that could possibly advise me.

1j949mw,Does the inability to achieve 100% certainty or clarity spiral you into distress?,mentalillness,1741733916.0,2,6,"Hi everyone,  
I've been struggling with this constant need for certainty and clarity in my life, especially when it comes to personal thoughts and perceptions. It feels like no matter how much I try to be sure of something, there's always doubt lingering. What really throws me off is that I can't seem to escape the feeling that *even people who are not mentally sound* can be convinced of their own clarity or normalcy. For example, the idea that *stupid* people never question their own intelligence, or that *crazy* people truly believe they are normal, can send me spiraling into self-doubt.

I grew up with a mother who had schizophrenia, and she was completely convinced of her delusions, which was extremely unsettling. I often find myself trapped in this paradox: how can we ever be certain of anything, when even those who are mentally unwell believe they are right?

Does anyone else experience this kind of thinking? How do you cope with the fact that it's impossible to be 100% certain about everything? Does the ambiguity cause you a sense of deep distress, or do you find ways to tolerate it?",i cant cope

For the last few months, almost year, I've been feeling empty. I'm in an amazing relationship with the most understanding and loving man there is. I know I love him. But for some reason, I don't feel love anymore, or happiness, or nothing. I'm just empty. 

To give you a bit of context, I was diagnosed with twice exceptional ADD (meaning I'm also on the autism spectrum) about 4 years ago. Before that, I had been dealing with chronic anxiety since my early teens (I lost my mom when I was 11) and I've had multiple depressions. I went to therapy most of my life but haven't been in a few years.

So, what should I do ? BF has been saying that maybe I have borderline personality disorder (since one of his exes had it and he's seeing a few similarities) but that scares me. I've been taking tests online and about half say yes or maybe, and half say no.

Well, I tried to overdose on zoloft last week, but I stopped thinking ""hey, maybe I don't wanna die"" fully unaware of the side effects

It's like watching the fire from a match reach my fingers while doing nothing to avoid getting burnt

I'm also slacking behind my tasks bcs I don't feel like doing them and I can't focus, and it's kinda sad to see how I might lose uni, my internship and the will to create something by myself

And I know that I said ""if anything bad happens, just call the psych ward, get me an appointment or admit me there"" but everytime this happens, I get incredibly scared and beg my partner not to take me away

1alqlc8,How do I get rid of the feeling of emptiness in my life? (My evolution from atheist to agnostic),mentalillness,1707378877.0,0,2,"Hi. I am 20 years old. I am 20 years old and I first started questioning when I was 13 years old. I accepted atheism between the ages of 13 and 15. But at the age of 15, I had a crisis of identity, if that's the right term, and I believed that I would never know the right answer to these issues. Because at the time I adopted atheism, I think I was no different from a theist.

Before I was accepting something I wasn't sure about, and after I was rejecting something I wasn't sure about. So since the age of 15 I've been under the umbrella of agnosticism. Theist agnostic, atheist agnostic... That's it.

With the emotional changes of teenage years, I started to think about death. I tried taking pills a few times, but without serious consequences, because I seemed to want to know what death was like more than I really wanted to die. The last time I took pills, I thought it was a very painful experience and I didn't try it again. 

When I started high school, I had a conversation with a friend of mine and he said something like ""just in case, I think you should accept the existence of a god. At least you'll have a chance to go to heaven"" or something like that. I agreed with my friend's opinion at some point, and this brought me closer to the idea of agnosticism. By the way, at that time, in 9th grade, my parents found my virtual diary where I wrote all my inner thoughts and managed to read it. They said they were going to take me to a psychologist, but I somehow convinced them because I didn't want to talk to anyone. By the way, my parents are Muslim. I tried to pretend that I was what they wanted me to be, otherwise they wouldn't leave me alone. They would constantly try to change my thoughts. Until then I considered myself an atheist, but in time I decided that I was agnostic because I didn't know what was true and what wasn't. Now I am on good terms with my family and they think I am Muslim. Because even if I say that I am not, they will not accept it. 

I don't know whether it was because I was thinking too much or because I was a quiet introvert, I started to experience derealization. At one point I felt it so strongly that I thought, ""I think God is punishing me by making me doubt my own reality because I denied God's reality"". When I was walking down the road, I had no problems and suddenly my surroundings seemed unreal. It wasn't something that happened all the time, but I still experienced it from time to time. Eventually I realized that the more I kept it in my mind, the more often I would experience it. That's what derealization was like for me. It was both enjoyable and disturbing at the same time.

Now I live less frequently than before, and occasionally when I feel bad I pray with my mother, hoping that maybe it will help. (by the way, I haven't prayed for a while, for months).

When I started university, I started to worry about dying without my family and about finding a job in the future. I had crying spells, a feeling of emptiness and I was overly dependent on my mother because I was afraid of dying alone and I was afraid of death because time was passing so fast and I didn't understand anything. I was afraid of being alone if I lost my family who had taken care of me all my life. So whenever I felt stuck, I started to think about the possibility of dying with my family. If we all died together, it would be a little less scary. So whenever I felt stuck I took refuge in this thought. It is uncertain when death will come and I am afraid of getting old and seeing the people I love die. When our teacher in high school said that atheism and agnosticism can lead to a feeling of emptiness, it didn't make sense to me, but I know I have experienced it.

I don't know how far it will go like this, but in general, every psychological distress I have always lies under this religious, philosophical thought or whatever it is. And I can't even explain it to my family. Maybe one day it would be good to get psychological support, but I don't know if I can find a solution. Have any of you experienced such a situation before? If so, I would appreciate if you share your thoughts.

18uxts4,I feel empty and bored with life,mentalillness,1703992273.0,2,1,"I (15F) want to start by saying that my life is objectively good. I have a great family and a really sweet boyfriend. I have decent grades, and I‚Äôm set to go to a good college. My family doesn‚Äôt have any serious financial problems. We live in a nice town, and I‚Äôm free to go out pretty much whenever I want. 
But this afternoon, I got to thinking. It all started on Christmas when my aunt gave me a lot of money as a gift. So today, I decided to go to Barnes and Noble to pick out a comic or a novel. I was looking for one of those books, comics, or manga where an ordinary kid/teen has to go on a quest to save the world or something, and finds a family in a ragtag group of misfits along the way. Specific, I know.
So, I began to really wish that something like that would happen to me. I really wanted that sort of excitement, and to make lifelong friends to share it with. I know, it‚Äôs kind of stupid, I‚Äôm not a kid anymore. But still, I really wished to find something life changing like that. Sometimes, I fantasize about packing my things, hopping on a bus to some random city and starting a new life, wandering around the country, maybe the world. I know, that would objectively be a horrible idea, you should only run away if you‚Äôre being abused or something, which I‚Äôm definitely not, and I could get into some serious trouble, but I‚Äôm still really tempted.
It‚Äôs been like this since I was a kid. Hell, I actually wished that there would be a zombie apocalypse for me to survive. In my defense, I was eight, and didn‚Äôt fully understand the implications of that genre.
I could chalk that up to regular childhood excitement. But one of the happiest memories I have was when I was a kid, and I managed to get my cousins that were in my age range to pretend that my dad was a monster and we had to hide from him, and kind of roleplay as apocolypse survivors. Again, normal thing for a kid to have fun with, I think. But I honestly can‚Äôt remember the last time I was happy, in that way, which didn‚Äôt involve playing pretend or reading or watching fantasy.
I think it might partially be because I had a lot of social difficulties growing up for reasons I don‚Äôt want to get into, and it was sometimes really hard for me to find a big group of friends. Nowadays, my social circle‚Äôs pretty limited. I have a handful of school friends, but that pretty much amounts to waving in the hallways and teaming up for school projects. Only person I really talk to outside of school is my boyfriend (note: I REALLY lucked out pulling him). So that might be part of why the ‚Äòjoining a ragtag band of misfits‚Äô fantasy is so appealing to me.
I‚Äôve been thinking about traveling a lot when I graduate, maybe even take a gap year, hopefully not in the spoiled rich kid way- I REALLY don‚Äôt want to be that guy, but honestly, I might be. But I think that even that wouldn‚Äôt make me super happy in the long run. Then again, I‚Äôve only ever traveled with my family, so it MIGHT fill the void in my life, haha. But anyway, it still feels too‚Ä¶ ordinary, I guess. And not to sound cringey, but I really don‚Äôt want an ordinary life. I keep wishing for one of those magical adventures to come my way, and I can do that. I know it‚Äôs stupid, and there‚Äôs a 99.999% chance that would never happen to me, but I keep wanting it. And I feel so empty, with my normal life. I‚Äôm sorry if I come off as spoiled, since, again, I have a great family, house, and decent opportunities awaiting me. But yeah, I feel really empty and bored.
I need advice. How do I stop feeling so empty?

The meds I was prescribed kind of help, they keep me from having the random fits, but I still get pissed at some of the stupidest things, and if I forget my medicine I turn into a raging dick. I even got fired from my last job because of it. I have never been able to keep a job for more than a couple years, and lately not more than a few months. And now, I can't find anyone who will hire me, even fast food and Walmart has denied me... we just lost our house today, and I don't know how I'm going to get us another. Luckily my son lives with his mother, my wife and daughter are staying with her parents, and I will be with my parents for a short time, but I don't get to see my family everyday now, and I can't figure out how to get around my issues to get and keep a job. I always tell everyone around me that I'm fine because I don't want them to worry, but I am getting more and more suicidal thoughts by the day. What's worse is that I also know that if the right trigger hits, I could go the opposite and become homicidal. And that scares me. I don't know what to do. And I can't tell my therapist these issues because she will lock me up in a psych ward and I need to be around for my children as much as I can. I'm not even sure that saying this all on here is a good idea, but at least nobody here can turn me in easily... and I really need to get this all off my chest or I'm going to burst... and it won't be pretty. I haven't been able to shower or eat properly in years, I don't really sleep much, and I've become addicted to video games and weed. I can't truly function anymore, but I can't stop functioning because I have too many responsibilities and I'm barely holding it together, often times not at all.

I tried over and over again, but it ended one of two ways; 1) they'd walk all over me and leave or 2) I would end up pushing them away. But I came to realise that the only thing that stayed the same was me. I'm the problem. So each time id swear ""never again"" and someone would enter my sphere and I'd change my mind, convinced I could be better. Anyways, this last time it was different. 

She was an anomaly. She stayed longer than most and I let my guard down, I got very comfortable. Too comfortable. In this instance it was the 1st outcome and I finally had enough and ended the friendship. But it didn't hurt like the others did. With the others it was agnonising heartbreak. This time I felt nothing. I still don't. I didnt think much of it at first, assuming that id been slowly burning away any emotion I felt towards her long before the friendship was offically over but then I tried connecting with people again. 

And I...cant anymore. I just can't. It's like this crushing exhaustion that loneliness can't seem to shake enough for me try as hard as I used to. I've tried non-seriously but I can't make anything stick and I always end up deciding that I dont want it to and just...stop. I've even given up on doing that. And all this has just made me think...maybe the last one didn't emotionally hurt me. But I think it broke something inside me. I think of it as a physical thing.That Ive tried so many times that my body has completely shut down, and am now incapable. I won't be able to connect with anyone like that again.

1ihe015,At my WITS END trying to find the right med combo,mentalillness,1738661643.0,0,1,"sorry in advance if this is rambly/incoherent, i am exhausted and feeling very lost and helpless.

I (born F, 29) desperately need advice re: medication and brain alphabet soup. I've been officially diagnosed with depression, GAD, OCD, CPTSD, BPD, and my biggest opp(osition), ADHD (specifically the fucking insomnia), which i was diagnosed with when i was like, 3/4/5, very young. i know there's new terminology now but i always remember my doctor telling me i was very present on both ends of the ADHD 'spectrum', and that i was also one of the worst cases he'd ever seen :') i have pretty significant medication trauma from being made to take meds from a young age against my will, along with the high dosages making me feel unlike myself. however I've been trying to work past that now in adulthood as i know medication is the most likely route to a more harmonious mind (i have done therapy and have a desire to continue it but i have moved and have yet to find a therapist covered by my insurance that has experience with my various issues and how they all interact). however, the medication i used to take a couple years ago doesn't seem to be working anymore and i am losing my mind a little bit. i would love any advice, recommendations, etc before my next appointment with my psychiatrist later this week. 
currently I'm on 37.5mg Venlafaxine, once daily, 120mg Lithium Orotate once daily, 50mg Hydroxizine once at bedtime, and 10mg Melatonin once at bedtime. Yet here i am, pushing three hours after I took my sleep meds, wide awake and nearly shaking with a weird, on edge feeling I can't shake. I have recently tried Clonidine (hit max dosage, didn't put me to sleep) and Guanfacine (again, didn't put me to sleep). And previously have also tried trazodone, which put me to sleep but gave me horrible headaches, and was immediately discontinued, and seroquel, which to be honest I don't remember how it did. Hydroxizine when used a number of years ago also put me to sleep quickly and easily but no longer seems to do the trick. I soend all of my waking hours feeling constantly somehow both on edge and completely disconnected, which i think could mean i need an increase in my Venlafaxine. I can't sleep at night, end up unintentionally crashing during daylight hours to get the bulk of my sleep (and no, daytime sleeping isn't stopping me from sleeping at night, when I make sure to stay awake all day i still can't sleep at night plus i get the added fun of feeling even more unhinged and delirious, so I'll take what little daytime sleep i can to at least keep me feeling a little sane), still feel fatigued during all waking hours, and still only manage 
to scrape up around 4-6 hours total. I've learned through trial and error in the past that around 10 hours is where i feel at my best and most capable, and anything 3hrs or less feels like i didn't sleep at all. If anyone has aby suggestions or ideas for a miracle sleep med that will knock me out for 10 hours I am begging that you please share, I'm willing to change my entire medication line up if there's interactions, I'll find other depression/anxiety meds if it means I'm actually sleeping well.

Turns out she was medicated when we met, and stopped her meds after about 6 months. it appears that 3 months after stopping, she loses her grasp on reality. She has done this 3 times now, got help, gone on meds, came back to being capable of employment, socializing, somewhat limited emotional stability. then she stops and the cycle starts again. Each 'crash' has gotten worse. 
She eventually told me a story of a nurse that used to visit her in her social assistance apt, and that the nurse tried to get her on a welfare program by saying she was schizophrenic. Now, i don't know if nurses can just say that, or if there needs to be a Dr to diagnose her. i think there is more to the story but ...
Any way, it seems she has some type of mental illness. She can't hold a job, can't get along with people, constantly believes all the wrong in the world is because someone is watching and influencing her surroundings. Cant absorb whats going on and is unbelieving when watching or reading world news. Classic paranoia, from what i have read. Throw in some narcissistic attitudes and here I am, living in  a nightmare. i have been called names, been threatened, my stuff has been broken.

The police refused to give me a protective order and the courts did too. A couple of days later, my brother called me again (where my son was still staying) and said he wanted him gone because he threatened to come to his place of business and assault someone. Normally, my son is not a violent person. He tends to be a keyboard warrior. So, I contacted my son and begged him to come with me to the hospital to get some help. I picked him up and he cursed me out to the ER. He was admitted involuntarily and stayed for a week. During the time he was medicated on day 4 he called and sounded like his old self. He told me he loved me and wanted to get better. He agreed to make me a part of his care team and I offered him support to get a plan in place. e. 

It has been a long 8+ years trying to figure out why he had angry outbursts lashing out at me, his father, my husband, his uncle, and grandmother.

I raised my son until he was 13 when after many instances of him stealing from me, refusing to listen, and not following house rules, it was best for him to go live with his father. He also said he wanted to go to live with dad and his father (who has always been minimally involved even when we were married ‚Äì a ‚ÄúDisneyland Dad‚Äù) wanted him to live with him after all attempts I made to understand and correct his behavior failed. His father refuses to speak with me because I divorced him. 

I remarried and my husband would not tolerate my then 13 yo disrespecting me. He has had an extreme hate for my husband even now, although since then my husband extended an olive branch even though he had never done anything except enforce boundaries and hold him accountable for his behavior. 

When he was in hs, his father let him raise himself. He didn‚Äôt supervise him, talked trash about me to our son (parental alienation) and caused a riff between us so my son did not speak with me consistently for nearly 2 years. When we reconnected, it was always rocky. I was supportive as possible, but in between my son would call me vile names, curse at me, and go from hot to cold in an instant. I now realize that he may have been rapid cycling. 

Fast forward to September 2023. He was living with my brother and was supposed to attend another semester of college. He‚Äôs managed to finish 2 semesters with my support. In August, I went with him to financial aid and did what I could to get him back into school in fall 2023. It was like pulling teeth, since that June I had been asking him about the FAFSA, even logging on to help him complete it, and working with school administrators and him for fall enrollment. It was very frustrating because when I‚Äôd ask him to follow up he‚Äôd not do so or would delay. In the end, he blamed me for not being in school that fall.

In September he began sending threatening texts to my brother and to me. His nasty texts and calls were persistent  over the years. He had never turned on my brother until recently. It‚Äôs like the fun loving personality he had has been erased. He calls himself a demon, tells me to find God and that I should f off. 

After getting these threatening texts, my brother wanted him to leave his home where my son was staying in the basement. Soon after, my son showed up at my front door. I opened the door and he said, ‚ÄúAdmit what you did!‚Äù I asked him what he was talking about and he explained that my brother and I ‚Äúsold him out to record business‚Äù (a delusion he still believes). He looked unkempt, hadn‚Äôt brushed is teeth, and his eyes were not the same. He then tried to force his way into my house after shaking me to get me to admit what I supposedly did. This frightened me and I pushed the door to prevent him from getting in. I had to call the police because he would not leave after I asked him many times.

He got out of the hospital in a week on a Saturday, and by Sunday he was in full delusions. My brother threw him out of his home that Monday while my son filmed himself getting kicked out, and he fled to NY to cousins he barely knows. My cousin called me and asked what was going on. I explained to her what occurred and the entire situation, that he was diagnosed with BP and that she should send him back once he‚Äôd rested (she said he came to her house hungry and looked off). She did the opposite and refused to back me. . ayed for a week. During the time he was medicated on day 4, he called and sounded like his old self. He told me he loved me and wanted to get better.

She told me that I needed to come get him from her house 6 hours away. I explained that driving there to come get someone who didn‚Äôt want to deal with me made no sense. He also had his car up there and the only way I could do it was if my son agreed, and my husband (whom he hates) had to come to help me bring his car down while I drive him back and figure out what to do next. She told me I should come without my husband because that would ‚Äúmake the situation worse.‚Äù I refused to. My son can be very manipulative, and I realized after many conversations with my cousin she wasn‚Äôt going to back me and ask him to leave. 

Since December he is unreachable by phone. His father pays for his phone and refused to tell me his whereabouts, which I asked him to do since he could see his last known call on his plan. So I filed a missing persons report earlier this month. The police reached out to his father and he told them he was in our local area. But I got a call from the police in NJ saying he refused to leave a hotel and they contacted me since I‚Äôd filed the missing persons report. I asked the officer to tell my son he could come back to us four states away (4. 5 hour drive).

mquvks,At my wits' end,mentalillness,1618419591.0,0,3,"*I'll try to keep this as compact as possible*

**Background**: My sister (38) is an Asperger's individual. She's disabled and in chronic pain due to her back and knees. She's on SNAP/SSI/Medicaid. She lives in low-income housing that's old and falling apart, and due to her inability to focus, her place is constantly a mess & a health hazard. Due to fixed income, is unable to move to a new location, and due to family issues, is unwilling to move back home. Due to bad lifelong experiences with doctors & psychiatrists and the Special Ed system in general, she has no trust or willingness to seek out mental healthcare, be it a therapist or medicines.

**Situation**: She's paranoid-delusional. She constantly believes someone (unknown) is out to get her, claiming that someone keeps leaving screws and nails underneath her patio chair. Moreso, and what has brought me to my wits' end, is she has had a series of dreams that she's absolutely immersed herself in in her waking life. She is convinced, no matter how much I try to rationalize with her, that there is a man (and I quote) named Jason Friesling, lives somewhere between Waco & Kempner TX, works on classic cars in his uncle's bodyshop - and that he is the man of her dreams. That's all well and good, except she has become OBSESSED with this fantasy, to scary levels, and she's CONVINCED that all of her problems will magically be solved if she finds this person, who probably doesn't even exist.

**What should I do?:** I'd be well and happy if my sister found someone who loves her and wants to take care of her. But she's absolutely closed off all doors to any relationship other than this one she's imagined in her head. She'll never find 100% the person she's looking for and is setting herself up for inevitable failure rather than learning to go with the flow of the river of Life.

I'll start by saying that my entire life has been plagued with a myriad of mental health disorders ranging from General Anxiety Disorder, Bipolar disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, ADHD, Social Anxiety, and some others that I can't be bothered to remember. At the ripe age of 18, I was emitted into a psychiatric ward because of extreme anxiety, and just last year I was emitted twice to the psyche ward because I tried to kill myself.

I've lost so many opportunities because of my unstable emotional health. I lost a decent job, and the chance with the most beautiful girl I've ever met, and because I can't socialize to save my life; I have little to no friends. The few remaining friends I have might be moving away soon, I've never felt lonelier in my life. Despite trying multiple medications, TMS and Spravto, I feel like I haven't gotten any better.

1jjjqp2,Need some advice on my current situation 30/M,mentalillness,1742910430.0,1,1,"Hi All,

I am hoping to get some advice from this community pertaining my current situation.

First off, i (32/m) am diagnosed with a ""mood disorder"", ADHD, CPSTD, OCD My psychiatrist did not really give what mood disorder do i have, but he mentioned that it is in a spectrum, which i do understand what he meant by that.

I am seeing my psychiatrist in a private hospital instead of a public hospital, as the treatment in the public hospital is very bad. And there are no insurance coverage for any psychiatric conditions in my country, despite my country claiming we have the best healthcare in the world.

So i am playing close to 1200 USD a month just on medications.

# Treatment Resistance

To add on to the mix, i have significant treatment resistance. My country does not offer any other treatment expect for Esketamine and ECT
I am not keen on ECT as the risk is too much, while Esketamine is extremely expensive, i am looking at 45,000 USD every 6 months.
Neighboring countries do offer other treatment for both long term and short term; such as cannabis. But it is a crime to consume cannabis regardless where i am consumed it in my country. 

# Relapse:

My Previous relapse was in Early September 2024 to Late October 2024 And now i am back to relapsing, in less than 5 months.
When i ""relapse"", i experience the following:

## Depressive mood:
Sudden and rapid decline of mood depressive episode.

## Su1cidal thoughts:
Uninitiated SUi thoughts, that rapid fires.
I also experience this where i am subconsciously finding for something to be depressed about, which then trigger more su thoughts

Before i seeked treatment many years ago, i was abusing alot of alcohol
i would sit down and consume alcohol while watching a suicide scene in a movie replayed on loop over and over again.
(I am 2 years sober now, thanks to vyvanse)

But as of recent relapse i have been craving alcohol. Thankfully i have not fallen into the trap.

## Crying spells
It either i feel like crying and i cant cry, or i just randomly start crying
Current Medication stop working
While on stimulant


While i am on my sitmulat, i am still experincing the affects of the relapse but i would be able to get out of bed, and get things done, the moment i stop doing activities even for a minute, everything will come rushing back, this also occurs when the simulant's effect is done for the day

## Current Medication
I am currently on the following medication and dose i am taking which was altered every couple of weeks when my relapse started about 3 weeks back

- Venlafaxine (VIEPAX) - 300MG; taken in the morning
- Vyvanse - 70MG Taken in the morning 
(i am allowed to skip, i was only able to write this post as it took it in the morning.)
- Olanzapine (Zydis) 10MG; taken at night
- Mirtazpine (Rameron) 30MG; taken at night

## Unable to sleep
Even with Olanzapine and Mirtazpine, i find myself unable to sleep. I had tried to take Dayvigo, which sometimes works and sometimes it does not.
I had tried Xanax 1.5MG, which worked initally after the 3rd time taking it,
it stopped working, now it does nothing to me.
I had tried Clonazepam, which had the same issue as xanax. Essentially all benzos do not work for me.

With the current medication cocktail, in the initial days, it seemed to had been working, my mood was somewhat stable.

However, as the days went, it stopped working.
Then i went back to my doc, he altered the dosage And Same behavior, worked for a few days and then BAM! stopped working,

And i honestly at my wits end, i am very lost. I do not know what to do anymore. I have already missed a month of work, in my current situation i cant go back to work, that will definitely take a hit on my career
And yes, i have tried therapy, again i am resistant to it, to make it worst, there is no requirment for theapist to be licenced in my country as such there are many ""scams""


I can't eat, i can't sleep well, i cant do anything.
What should i do. I really do not know what is going on with me, and i am really exhausted and i want to give up

We‚Äôve been trying to talk to doctors and get a diagnosis and start treatment but the mental health system of my country is a bit lacking so we need a bit more time before we can see a doctor.

In the meanwhile she has started an alternative treatment plan which we are hoping will help her.
I needed some advice on how to speak to her and pacify her as much as possible, if anyone has been in a similar situation.

So she believes that someone at work has hacked all her online presence and has sensitive information about her. She‚Äôs worried that they‚Äôll leak the information in public and she feels humiliated about this. This got really bad but I, along with her parents were able to atleast pacify her to the point where she agreed on treatment. But now she has a different fear that everyone around her is imitating her in one way or another and this is putting her in a huge amount of distress.

How should I pacify her on this and help her feel atleast a bit better, so that she continues her treatment? I‚Äôm kind of at my wit‚Äôs end here so will appreciate any help. Thanks!",at my wits end

i don't know what to say, i just wanna say something. every day i feel pain because of my depression, anhedonia, loneliness, probably ptsd too. mental pain. i've stopped using drugs but i don't even have people in my life who would say they proud of me besides my gf. well, my psychologist says that but they're supposed to because i pay them for this. it feels wrong.

having a gf doesn't mean i'm not lonely, for fucks sake. i still crave human connection, hugs, sex, long talks, deep talks about meaning of life, about death, universe, everything. i feel like a burden to my gf because she can't fill the void inside me no matter what. i have no friends besides her and it hurts. she's supportive af but it barely makes me feel better and i feel guilty cause of that.

i was never able to find a male friend, they all seem too aggressive or competitive or just uninterested in general. but making friends with females is hard for me too because i start thinking about having sex with them etc. i don't do anything bad towards them nor i want to, i just have to wear a mask all the time it's exhausting. horniness is a curse. hypersexuality. but i don't even mind sex as much as hugs. long hugs. not just receiving, but also giving. this is a key difference between me and (most/many) other horny men who don't give a shit about what other side feels.

it also feels bad because i'll be hitting my 30s in a few years and it kinda sucks because it's getting harder and harder to make friends. everyone already have friends and they're not willing to engage with someone who's lonely. it's not my fault i feel lonely. it's just the way i am. beautifully fucking ugly way i am.

what's interesting, is that i've found its even harder to make friends with mentally ill people like me. it's just too much of a chaos. incompatibility. weirdness. so here i am - stuck between worlds, between good and bad, between life and death. battling with suicidal thoughts but do not see why, for what reason. i can't find a right place for me. and i don't know anymore if i want to. i never knew honestly, i just keep going because i have hope.",lonely

1gww31x,I want to die but I am just lonely and need someone ,mentalillness,1732238744.0,1,4,"F18, not sure if anyone will see this or care, it honestly doesn't matter to me. I want to just go ahead and show that I recognize the good things in my life before I say anything morbid. I have a good amount of friends who love me, my sister loves me, I have access to therapy and a psychiatrist, and have developed good understanding of mental health. However, regardless of these things, I still feel very alone and isolated, which is why I am so desperate to seek a way out. 

Things have been a bit rocky for me ever since I was young. I always find myself reliving trauma and depression as a result over and over again in different forms. I have committed before, but always have been caught in the act and immediately sent to the hospital. As I've done research, the pills I tried to OD on  wouldn't have worked anyways, so I basically made a fool out of myself for nothing. 

I have listened to advice given to me from friends, family, and mental health professionals, but I seem to still struggle no matter how much I try. Coping skills to me have become pointless, and no matter how loved I am, I have automatically chosen not to accept it nor feel it. 

I love and am happy for the good experiences I have encountered. Feeling at peace has always been my wish, but I never seem to reach the full extent. Going out with friends used to feel exciting, but now it just feels like a useless distraction. I know I am so young and still have so much to experience, but honestly knowing myself, I'd probably be dead by my mid 20's if not now. 

You all probably wonder what makes me feel so down all the time, or why I am like this. Short answer, I don't know. I have been through a lot, and basically raised into neglect of my differences regarding my intense emotions. I was also raised into facing verbal abuse and sometimes physical with my family members disagreeing on stupid things. At the time, learning to know what love is was hard.

One time I got to experience love, romance even. Through this girl, I learned so much about myself. I learned I was a lesbian, and even felt deserving of the love she gave me. She would buy me gifts, and even got me a feel better gift when I'd be struggling. It felt unreal, too good to be true. She was the first person who made me feel like I mattered. Which is why when she left suddenly after 8 months and a plan of a lifetime future together, I was absolutely heartbroken, and it felt like I had seen someone completely different. She did anything to make sure I'd know she didn't care. She basically left me to rot alone and didn't consider how much it affected me. I am still not over it even after 1.5 years. I'm sure most of you know why this breakup affected me so much.

I am aware it is not good to depend on someone for your worth of living, but I didn't. If anything she made me more independent and encouraged me to love myself during the relationship. I think the part that hurt the most was the pure confusion. I'll never get answers, and that's okay. 

I don't want you guys to assume she was the main reason I started feeling like this. Even though it hurting a lot is an understatement, I felt like this even before the relationship, which I feel like I already got into. I feel like her leaving just made it more intense again. She helped me see the good in everything. I loved her more than anything and truly envisioned my whole life with her. She was my person, my purpose, and my heart. 

Currently, I am reflecting a lot on what to do now. I don't want to live anymore, but part of me just knows I need company again. My only close friends are busy in their own relationships. I feel so behind when I'm around them. They all talk about applying for college, when I'm still behind in online school. I feel so isolated from them and not tended to. I am usually almost always the first to reach out. I understand they are busy, but I need them, more than anything. I am so lonely, especially since I'm states away currently because I'm living with my sister for a month due to being kicked out by my mom and needing space. 

As embarrassing as it is, I've downloaded dating apps and friend apps, like Wizz. It never worked out honestly and just made me feel worse about myself because nobody interacted with me. I have no way to meet new people because I do online school. I sometimes think I've developed agoraphobia.  

I need advice, real advice. Not something that I've heard already-- like how I need to get into new hobbies, distract myself, or go outside, because it's not that simple. I'm going to try, but honestly I just need more friends. I need someone I can rely on, talk to all the time, and feel prioritized. I am extremely lonely and it has sent me into suicidal episodes. Someone, anyone talk to me.

more functional, and basically just better. But in order to function and not feel anxiety, i ""have"" to wear clothes that i bought like 7 years ago and dont look good at all. I have this with a lot

of things. Basically i call these things ""forbidden"", its usually things i really want to have, but when i own them or especially when i wear them i hyperfocus on them, the more meaning they have to me,

the more i obsess about them and i get headache and anxiety when i own them. Before i own them, i want these things badly, but when i have them, i do feel good, but then i start ruminating about them

24/7 to the point i have heavy anxiety the whole time, feeling like stuck in my head. Even with girlfriends, when i try to get a womans number for example, i feel normal, but once i have their number,

rumination starts and in the past i actually thought this rumnination had a meaning, but now i am very convinced it is a mentall illness that has stopped me from following my dreams and doing the things

i want in life. Most of the times, i feel like, i prioritize functioning and being concentrated over following the things i want, but this behavior has made me a very depressed person and i feel like,

i dont even know how to think. I also realized that the only times, i feel happy is, when i am doing the things i really want even tho i may not feel so sharp or copncentrated. I have read a few books

about OCD, Overthinking and Social anxiety because i believe that i have GAD, OCD, SAD, ADHD. The ocd things are basically almost magical thinking (putting a meaning in to the things that are forbidden and

cause anxiety), it can simply be a new pant that i bought of amazon that i needed, but when i wear it, rumination starts and i think ""maybe its the wrong color?"" even tho there is nothing wrong with the

color it the pants are much more comfortable than my previouse. I definitly have problems with anxiety, i think it is genetically and adhd probably as well. I always check if things are allowed by for

example imagining them and when i feel anxiety, they are not allowed because in the past i have put a meaning to it and really thought that they are ""bad"". I once bought my dream motorcycle and i bought

it in a color i do not like so much because, i thought that when i dont like it so much, i wont ruminate about it. Basically opposite happened and it was very intense and trying to think the ""right way"",

trying to convince my brain ""its right color, pls stop"". Ended up selling it because of the symptoms, like everything else i wanted. Also combines with the fear of failure alot, because i feel 

unfunctional when i own ""Forbidden Things"". I also had forbidden activities in the past, but i managed to overcome alot of them. This lifestyle has led me to avoid ALOT in past 9 years. It all started with my first panic

attack. After that day, i was constantly ruminating that something is wrong with me and i had physical anxiety symptoms most of the time, wich has led me to quit a good job i had. 2 Years after the

 the first panic attack i started to feel better, but when i felt better i started to put a meaning to it, as to why i suddenly felt better and i knew that this meaning is illogical but this way of 

 thinking erased anxiety completly. Basically, what i then started to believe is that, all my thoughts are true and feelings validate the ""trueness"" of a thought, this is basically the coping mechanism 

 i developed when anxiety started to drop. This way of thinking has led me to believe very very strange thinks like ""i will not ask my boss for a payment rise, because i dont deserve it"", i put meaning 

 in the imagination of asking my boss for a payment rise, because i experienced anxiety when imagining it. This type of thinking is VERY VERY VERY self destructing, especially over a long time period.

So this type of thinking is still kind of rooted in to my brain, but because i educated my self on it, i can see the mental illness. So far i have read the books ""Rewire your OCD Brain, Brain Lock,

I'm not saying these feelings are not bad, they are very unpleasant, but having these feelings is not the same as having an actual panic attack where you're hyperventilating and feel like you're about to die (that's how it felt for me when I had a panic attack). 

I know that everyone has different symptoms with panic attacks so perhaps I'm just not aware of how subtle they can be. 

I'm not trying to dismiss anyone's experiences or feelings, I'm just confused about the way the term 'panic attack' is being used these days, because in my experience panic attacks have been debilitating, not just a momentary thing.

Do some of ya'll find that your panic attacks look 'quiet' to outsiders? That's basically what I'm asking. Sorry if this is a stupid question. I don't want come across as rude if someone's saying they're having a panic attack and it looks different from how I expected them to look.

I have subsequently been taking 1mg about 3 times a day and the moment it starts wearing off, the physical symptoms return and I need to re-dose.  it feels like I'm going to have a heart attack, the left side of my body goes numb, my sinuses close up, and I am out of breath if I don't take it. I don't know what to do anymore and can't take off work. today I took 1mg of Xanax and 5mg of diazepam and I guess the fear and anxiety are exacerbated as I don't want to OD. I don't know what to do and I would appreciate any advice. 

my diet has gone down the drain, my motivation is at an all time low and I cant cope with the physical symptoms of anxiety/panic attacks anymore.

It‚Äôs been several days now and I wake up with a discomfort feeling in my chest, it feels like I'm holding my breath, on the edge of breaking down and hyperventilating.  


My thoughts roam with obsessive/absurd ideas making it difficult to calm down and relax, my muscles start aching and I feel as I become more distressed to the point of showing physical agitation. I start sweating as if someone raised the temperature in the room, the discomfort of my being in my own skin, the agitation continues to gnaw at me while my brain screams at me.


I can‚Äôt breathe and It‚Äôs triggering. As the distress and feeling of a panicked emergency take‚Äôs place, I want to desperately run to someone, get on my knees and beg for help, I need help. By then and now I feel trapped and paralyzed, I feel imprisoned and my own body won't respond. I don‚Äôt want to feel this way again. I want to make it stop, I'm scared.


Forget being scared because by then everything is already out of control. Something is very wrong but I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt know what it is but I need help because my mind is screaming and it‚Äôs triggering, I want it to stop, please.


Oh, by then I can‚Äôt stop sobbing, I can‚Äôt control my tears. By then it felt like I met my demise again and again. Something about being in distress while being screamed at just goes together. While being yelled at and confronted for not listening and cooperating, I try to control my breathing because by then I'm hyperventilating and having a panic attack. It felt like the world just collapsed on me, this is not what I wanted, in such a situation I didn‚Äôt think that I would be finding myself worried that the neighbor‚Äôs would hear me getting screamed at and that a poor indoor grill had to face the wrath of suddenly being broken due to this person all because I couldn't stop my panic attack and it pissed them off.

So, I‚Äôve never talked about this publicly, but I feel like I need to. I just need to find someone who understands whats happening to me and maybe even why, or someone with this experience too.

I‚Äôve always struggled with mental illnesses, besides being autistic, I‚Äôve been diagnozed with depression and other stuff. It started getting pretty bad around age 12, thats when I was diagnozed with the depression and also macropsy/micropsy (i hope thats what its called, i forgot).
Anyway, at that time it wasnt that bad in retrospect, I was a depressed teen, self harmed, skipped school and whatnot, but all in all I was pretty functioning at the time.

It all started going to where it is now when I was about 17 (I‚Äôm 20 now), I was really depressed at the time, but never struggled much with anxiety and panic attacks of any sort, I did make a failed attempt at my life around this time, which to this day not many people know about, but I somehow recovered enough to feel like myself again and I was pretty fine until I was 19 and made the great decision to take LSD when I totally am not the type of person to be taking that.

It was bad, but I dont think its what caused what I‚Äôm experiencing right now, mightve slightly triggered it, but I feel like this would happen at some point regardless.

Now, the actual problem, about a month after that bad trip I started getting really bad panic attacks, constantly. Seemingly out of nowhere, my heartbeat rapidly picks up, my whole body goes numb, sort of like an extreme version of that kind of anxiety you get when youre on a plane and realize you forgot to take your charger to a two week vacation. It started with this one panic attack, that was sort of triggered by me thinking about a story I wanted to write (I write a lot, and this specific story had a sort of ‚Äúend of the world‚Äù theme, which was always my favorite genre, and never caused me issues) but that night, out of nowhere, I start panicking while thinking about it, I felt like I was laying in a bed of ice and I was dying, I had no clue what to do since that never happened to me before as far as I‚Äôm aware. Then, as the days went on, it went from one panic attack a day, to every night (I had to put on a documentary and just wait until I pass out cause I couldnt fall asleep without a distraction), then it was constant, just never ending pain and panic, so I reached out for help, I got taken to a crisis centre and prescribed with cipralex, which I take to this day.

After a few months of the panic attacks mellowing out, I returned to normal, I barely thought about it and just went along living my life, which is not the best life, but I‚Äôm comfortable. It was a year since the panic attacks started, and it had been months without one at that point, and I was fine.

Then, recently, I started smoking weed a lot, and having a lot of fun with it, but I do admit I definitely overdid it, and I‚Äôve since stopped. But the panic attacks came back, and it honestly felt like my life is over. Ive never been afraid of death, but these panic attacks set that fear in me really strongly.

I no longer have the panic attacks daily, they still happen but ive been making some progress, but I just feel so lost. Constantly I feel like I‚Äôm not real, everything and everyone looks so weird to me, just this off feeling and pit in my stomach at all times. Everytime I manage to calm down and just be idle for a while, I suddenly gain consciousness out of nowhere and my brain just goes ‚Äúwow life sucks and nothing is real and I cant do this anymore‚Äù. Just endless derealization and a strong dread looming over me and I‚Äôm so tired.

",mentalillness,1735953273.0,3,3,"I have PTSD, treatment resistant depression, combined type ADHD, autism, and ARFID; and (while it's not a mental illness) I'm pretty sure I also have a circadian rhythm sleep disorder. It all adds up together to an immense amount of frustration. 

I have 3 separate needs from mental health treatment: to be able to focus, to be able to sleep, and to be less depressed. And apparently that's a lot to ask for. I don't blame all of the doctors I've seen that I'm still trying to figure that shit out, but I really hate it.

I'm just... Tired. I'm tired of constantly adjusting depression meds when nothing works. I'm tired of being unable to sleep, because for some reason nothing works for that either. I'm still trying to adjust my Adderall dose so that it actually works, so on top of all that, I can't focus or stay organized or do anything, including stuff that I need to do. 

I've tried everything possible for insomnia and anxiety that isn't a controlled substance; my psychiatrist won't prescribe more than 1 controlled substance at a time, but I'm not sure that z-drugs are ""every night"" sorts of options anyway. I even did a full round of CBT-I, which I paid for out of pocket so that I wouldn't have to take a break from trauma therapy. I've gotten less than 5 hours of sleep every night this week. This wasn't an issue at all until I developed PTSD 4 years ago, and hasn't worsened with Adderall. 

For depression, I feel like I've tried everything that isn't an MAOI (which I can't take, because ARFID). Antidepressants, off-label antipsychotics, lithium, whatever else. I even had 58 sessions of electroconvulsive therapy over about 18 months in 2015-2016. My insurance doesn't cover Spravato. Gotta love it. 

I've been trying to figure out ADHD stuff for months now. I had to stop taking Concerta last year because it made me extremely dehydrated and caused a lot of issues with muscle tension, but it *worked.* I could focus. I could be organized. I was calm. 

I've been trying to figure out Adderall for 4 months, and we just increased my dose to 15mg. Except my resting heart rate was already at 115 bpm, and my psychiatric NP didn't want to prescribe a beta blocker, so I need to talk to my PCP, who will hopefully agree to do it without additional cardiac testing. She also lowered my Wellbutrin XL dose from 300mg to 150mg, to try and handle the heart rate thing, but I'm not too confident that it'll work out great. So that's frustrating, because I'm not too keen on feeling more depressed and still struggling with Adderall side effects. 

Medical stuff triggers me. I know that I'm triggered, because I feel like I'm always going to be a miserable insomniac who can't focus enough to do anything that he actually cares about.

I've only been diagnosed with PTSD for 3 years, and ADHD for 2. So you'd think that I'd feel hopeful about using this information to help with the depression, but right now I don't. I just feel frustrated. This sucks. 

I also did EMDR therapy yesterday about issues with medical neglect, so that probably isn't helping things. Ugh. 

I dunno if anyone is actually gonna read all of this. But it just sucks so much to be struggling with all of these different psych issues. ",insomnia

First time experiencing what I think is a mental breakdown at work, and I really use some advice. My jobs have typically been relatively long hours. I worked in Finance for a couple of years. I'd usually finish work at around 8pm/9pm, and spend the rest of the evening studying for exams - either to 1am or 2am. This was during lockdown, and even when things were re-opening. I went for ages without seeing people. If I failed the exams, my job would be terminated. It was a bit stressful, but I totally managed. I did well in my exams, tough at times, but I was completely fine. It was three months of being very busy, but after, I had a more normal routine. I left that job two and a half years ago, to do what I thought would be my dream job. It was incredible for the first 6 months, almost too good to be true. I'd reliably finish around 7pm, and did not feel overwhelmed ever. I couldn't believe how relaxed it was. Then things got busy. Since Jun-2023 until Jun-2024, a 10pm finish (starting at 9:40am) would be a very very good day. I'd say for a year, mostly, working hours have easily been 9:40 am to midnight at least, often 2am, and at worst 5am. I had a panic attack in Feb-24, for the first time in my life. I had two weeks of leave in March which helped. Then, this Jul-24, it was suddenly quiet-ish for two weeks. I think everything caught up with me at once. I have not felt like myself for a few months. A constant voice in my head telling me I'm a failure, a ""can't do"" attitude, not wanting to eat, struggling to remember basic things, terrible short-term memory, cynicism, and a dread for the future. Against, this background, work has started to get busy, and my mind is not in a good state. I had a call this morning with my boss and the CFO. I was already in tears before the day started. I couldn't follow a single thing on that call. He asked if I understood what was going on - I had no idea. I just had to say ""no, I'm sorry, I'm not following, and I need to be on sick leave."" The people I work for are incredibly kind - my manager is amazing. I do not know how she does it. I think her hours are worse than mine. Every day I never ever want to let her down. But I just reached a limit that I could not push through today. I am going to the GP today for an appointment, as I need some support. But, I do not know how to handle this matter at work. We are a very small team, and for some reason, there is a reluctance to hire. Senior management know that if one of us has a funeral to attend, we are understaffed, and have to push back on work. This is freely known. There does not seem to be any room for unexpected leave. If I took time off, I will push more work onto others. The CFO will ask if I am better on Monday, and I have no answer for this question. I will not be better for a while (but know I will get there.) Has anyone been in this situation before and have any advice?

1c4ee6m,workaholic parents + Burnout,mentalillness,1713158857.0,0,3,"Does anyone else suffer from a dysfunctional family that centers around money, working alot and forced toxic positivey about doing stuff everyday to ""improve your life""?

He doesn't understand my autism and had made no attempts to see the struggles it causes. Especially for burnout and exacerbating ocd flares

I know on the surface it's a good thing but in practice it becomes draining and depressing. My Dad used to drink and smoke alot but now never does drinking nor smoking. He may have the casual beer after a hard day of work but it's only one.

Now he spends his free time watching ""self improvement"" videos with people like Jocko Willinks and Tony Robbins and James Clear (Atomic Habits). Holding what they say is true due to hearing it from other successful people who made alot of money. He Believes in self discipline and ""happiness is in the mind"" type mindsets. He told me today to ""get out of my comfort zone"" and push yourself because ""I'm not even trying"".

For a while I did so too. I pushed myself alot trying to get a degree in computer science and then working full time in retail during summer breaks. But the anger and mental torment I got from pushing myself wore me down. Plus I had a streak of bad luck with prof teachers and was constantly stressed about passing 24/7. Ontop of that I had lazy roommates who were passive aggressive and touched my stuff while I was gone. I knew I should have said something bug I felt like there would be tension and I had enough of it.

Chronically anxious made me depress and it caused me severe burnout. I felt drained and dragging my feet trying to finish classes. I was mad and pissed off at the unfair circumstances I was in.

The work I did at the moment made no impact because now I have moved back in with my Dad who is a severe workaholic and is Disappointed by my lack of effort to even get out of bed at a reasonable time. I wake up so sad and I feel like he never understands why I'm so pessimistic.

I live in Canada where the economy is in shambles and buying a house seems like a ""pie I the sky"" sort of deal. I want to have goals but the OCD and depression make each day a drain as I wake up and do stuff then immediately feel like sleeping again.

I have a psychiatrist but they don't understand ocd and just hope the pills will work. I'm on 100 mg of zoloft, 50mg of regular seroquel in the day, 100mg of seroquel xr at night and 1mg of klonopin daily.

I try to help my Dad but then he always ""moves the goal post"" and gives criticism to my flaws then acknowledging all the work I do for him. Like yesterday I helped him out in the yard for 4 hours. But today I had to do homework so he complains I didn't help him at all today and ignores yesterday. Never grateful for what I do to help him.

He yells alot and ""tells me to fuck off"" which he says he doesn't mean it after. But it hurts when he yells and keeps going off. I even don't like bringing stuff up as he goes on and on about stuff. Good or bad. He just talks my ear off. If I don't do what he says and give him reasons he sees them as excuse and yells at me. Even him saying he's ""talking nicely"" is condensing and is out to judge me and make me feel guilty.

Just tonight I asked if I could quickly brush my teeth and he told me to ""fuck off"" because I was using up his time. He has only an hour of free time before going to bed and can't waste five minutes to let me brush my teeth as I get too tires after watching the show. So he yells and makes me feel bad. He doesn't even stay up the whole time we were watching the show so that's annoying.

I try to love him but his working attitude is insane. He goes to bed at 12am and wakes uo around 4am to either go to work which is an hour drive there and an hour drive back. Or he's doing paperwork. He complains that he hates it but ""life is 80 percent bullshit and 20 percent fun"". Which makes me even more pessimistic. I feel tired just listening to him about it. Even other topics as he goes on and on talking. Just doesn't know when to shut up.

My mom is not better. If I miss a day of my retail job due to ocd flare she tells me to ""suck it up and go to work"". She's a whole new can of worms but both have done their part to ruin my development.

Anyways that's my rant. Does anyone have similar parents? What have you done in terms of burnout and ocd? I take supplements Like Ashwagandha, L-theanine, gaba, magnesium bisglycinate, and 5-http.

I have read a bit of atomic habits and the daily stoic 366 meditations by Ryan Holiday. Please any advice would be helpful. Thanks and have a good day

When I am awake, I spend like an hour just to recover from sleeping so long, and then I don't feel like doing anything. Not even eating. It's thanks to my girlfriend, who I live with, who is amazing btw, that I barely eat something. Before we move in together, I don't even eat until it physically hurt my stomach. My sleeping schedule is messed up too. I stay up until 5 am and then go to sleep. I only feel like dragging myself out of bed at 3 pm. Sometimes I sleep until 6 pm if my girlfriend doesn't actively yell to wake me up. This was during lockdown so I think it's part of the reason. When I say I don't feel like doing anything, it's everything. I used to be able to play video games for 5-6 hours straight with no down time. Now just one hour and I already feel like it's not worth it. I just sit and do nothing with YouTube running in the background. I care less and less about my personal hygiene. I shower and brush my teeth every 3-4 days now. I know it's disgusting but I can't help it. I feel like I have no energy to do anything. Even going out to eat is a chore to me. I just want to sleep all the time. The only time I feel ""normal"" is when I go out on dates with my girlfriend. But as soon as we are back home, I lost all energy. I have no real friend other than my girlfriend. My connection with my family is not bad, but it's not intimate either. So she mostly all I have. I feel like my emotions are numb. I do feel emotions, but my emotional range is from 3.9 to 4.1 (with 10 is the happiest day ever). I love my girlfriend, and I'll do anything for her. Yes I simp and down bad for her. But she can only get me so far up to 5. I feel like I'm detached from reality. I don't use social media anymore, unless you count half watching YouTube as one. I don't know what wrong with me. I talked with my girlfriend about it multiple times about it. But how can I explain it to her if I don't even know what's happening. I considered therapy but where I am, it's not widely available, mostly because no one care. And it's too expensive too for my half bad job that I can only do at night for couple hours with minimum wage because of my condition. 

Now I'm not here asking for help, atleast not financially. I just want to vent, because like I said, I have no friend. All I want is there are people in the world know how I feel. Thank you for listening to my TED talk.",burnout

Hi so I‚Äôm typing this while being on hold at the hospital due to a psychosis attack.

I need some helpful tips to have this conversation with my mom. I went to therapy because of an abusive relationship with my ex that resulted in me getting groomed and eventually r*ped. It went good at first but then I ended up seeing my therapist less. My mom did a few things to make my mental state worse (mainly due because of lack of understanding what I‚Äôm going through and went through) and it caused me to be mentally worse than I was before.

I have used weed and other substances to cope with my trauma, depression, and my dissociative symptoms from my CPTSD. With no intention to take my life, it just makes what I‚Äôm going through more bearable than sober. I had to hide it from my mom, but today she found out because of my sister telling her. I‚Äôm not mad at my sister, but my mom wants the three of us to talk about this situation. I‚Äôve been clean for awhile but that probably won‚Äôt have any leverage.

I am from a Latin family so mental illness isn‚Äôt taken so seriously and my mom is Gen X. Any advice that I can get on how to explain to her my mental wellbeing and with my substance abuse will be greatly appreciated üå∏üå∏",substance abuse
mwmig2,My journey so far with panic disorder and substance abuse.,mentalillness,1619149322.0,1,2,"This will mostly be a vent post and just me sharing a few bottle of the barrel things I go through daily, lol

I'm 18 years old, I have a strong and deep carving panic disorder that's been passed down by my dad's side of the family alongside addiction of every type and alcoholism. I had quite the abusive childhood varying to nearly type,  excluding sexual. Also very sad and damaging events that occur still to this day that have psychologically damaged my path. Before 16 I didn't suffer from panic disorder as much as other things like mania and bipolar that I was being treated for, but after this age I started smoking weed and enjoyed it for a couple months up until I was given synthetic cannabis created in a lab with over 8 strains and whatever else could have been sprayed. Nearly tried to kill myself as it gave me a high no soul could live with, my reality smashed like a mirror. My heart raced and pounded, I puked but didn't pass out. Pure anxiety made me disregard the vomit and run around in it during my first ever psychotic and possibly schizoactive panic attack. I've never been the same since that day unfortunately, but it goes away with mental maintenance. Ever since then I get the same symptoms smoking marijuana. Pounding heart, full blown psychosis from any level of thc and a guaranteed panic attack. 

Fast forward to now being 18 years old, please be judgement free because this is hard to admit but I'm a daily user of meth since January.
I did lethal amounts of cocaine for the slightly younger lad I was at 17 to the point where I'd be falling asleep. Doing an 8 ball in a few hours or so with a 150 resting heartrate. I did maybe 60 grams of cocaine in 2020. Cocaine is where my heart palpitations started and I only went to get them checked out in a meth induced panic attack giving me an arithmia a few weeks ago. They took me to my infamously shitty hospital in an ambulance only to wait me out to see if a further cardiac event would occur and kicked me out 12 hours later without letting me speak to a doctor. Hopefully meaning I'm not in immediate risk of a cardiac event but sometimes my symptoms are mind shattering. I haven't seen a doctor in years besides that trip to the ER.

I have been using meth every single day since January and I've noticed something interesting, my panic attacks can no longer occur after being awake for more than 30 hours or so. Very unhealthy with or without drugs so do not try it. Meth either gives me a panic attack lasting anywhere from minutes to an entire goddamm day when I first started doing it. If I'm using and experiencing zero panic I get nearly zero palpitations, unless I start feeling my pulse purposely and overthinking it because I have nothing better to do and my brain goes haywire just feeling the heart,  and I immediately go into fight or flight.

I've taken 1 real tolerance break because I went absolutely insane with attacks, the break lasted a few days which was when I made that trip to the ER so I'm quite worried to get sober. My everyday symptoms include extreme irritation, strong tightness in my chest and muscles that has reduced after taking magnesium supps, strange darting across my body, tremors, blur in vision on heartbeats, nausea but never upchuck anything. Mind shattering cardiophobia to the point where weeks back I was afraid to move a muscle sometimes for hours. Most hours of the day I can feel my heartbeat by simply placing my hand most places on my body like the throat, chest, all of both arms and legs. I have superficial vains that visibly beat with my pulse. Palpatations sometimes multiple times a minute for hours no matter the amount of drugs I've taken that day although I get them much less sober. My heart pounds so hard I can see my chest, vains in my wrists, and even my stomach and damn throat bounce and pound.

I've noticed way too many things and sensations about my body and I drive myself up the wall about all of them.  I'm moving out of my current living situation so hopefully that helps because life is hell right now. Its safe to say to not do meth with panic disorder, or at all. It definitely made it worse tenfold.

DMs are open and will answer any questions. Would love opinions and Incite. I wrote this in a panic attack so forgive how all over the place it was.

My income is substantial and includes full employment disability plus the maximum ""I'm Crazy"" 900 per month of paid work, plus I'm just skilled at finding someone who needs help and profitting or donating - usually at an eventual profit, whatever they need to resolve their house/car/life repairs.

That being said, I'm at about 10% of my potential - and I'm considering Electro Therapy as every time I smoke high-grade pot and have a petit-mal seizure, I have two or three fabulous, stable and productively focussed days.

Will I lose my special ""something""?  

Will I lose my ability to scream at injustice and my commitment to force a nuclear bomb factory out of my hometown?

Will I become a shuffling shell of my former self?

Fear is the enemy... and I skin my own mules as far as damage control and continuing to be productive in the context of my horrific personal flaws.

I am scared, but fear is and always will be the one thing I run straight at.  

I'm thinking yes.  I actually built a home brewed ECT machine when I was 11 and enjoyed the effects.

Growing up, he was a very secluded person as well as incredibly aggressive and emotionally manipulating to me and my mother.

In my case, I don‚Äôt have an active sex life because I take anxiolytics and birth control, which reduced my libido. Nowadays, I no longer feel the urge to engage in sexual relationships with others, although I‚Äôve had relationships in the past.

I suspect that I might have borderline personality disorder, but since the sexual aspect isn‚Äôt important to me, the psychiatrist said it‚Äôs unlikely that I have the disorder. Also, I don‚Äôt abuse substances like drugs or alcohol.

The signs I identify with are emotional dependence, fear of abandonment, impulsivity in some areas, like shopping, not thinking much about the consequences, excessive and unfounded anger, mood swings, among others.

I have nothing to feel good about. My last 25 years working with nothing to show for it! I have lost all confidence, self belief, and enthusiasm for the future and I have also now developed anxiety and social anxiety. I'm currently jobless after being made redundant. I have nothing to offer any prospective partner and I'm feeling lonely and hopeless.

To make things worse I recently had my biggest ever win of just over ¬£50,000 after finding a site which I wasn't excluded from. I even withdrew it and had it in my bank. This leads me on to where I am now and the bit most people won't understand. Despite this win being a massive opportunity to get my life back on track, maybe put a deposit down on a place to live and treat myself and my parents to a much deserved holiday, my addiction completely took over my state of mind. I completely lost control. I lost a small part of this win and as an addict, I had to win it back. In trying to do so I lost everything and I'm back to square one only without a job as well. It's only after doing it that reality hits along with the feelings of anger, depression, frustration and hopelessness. A massive reminder of why I can never gamble and have since excluded from every site I know about. 

This doesn't help my current situation. My parents are visibly getting older and older and are clearly starting to struggle. I could have treated them to an amazing holiday as a way of saying thank you but as usual I messed up with my addiction to blame. I completely understand that people will not understand.

1i4vr7d,"Recovering Opioid addict currently on Buprenorphine, but doctor gave me a small prescription of Clonazepam for my anxiety. Need some advice?",mentalillness,1737283063.0,4,3,"Okay, I know this is going to be a long post, but I want to be completely transparent about my circumstances so I can get the right advice or help from anyone who may have had a similar experience or has advice on how to move forward from here. I am 38 year old male who has battled addiction to opiates since I was 20 years old. I grew up with two highly dysfunctional, alcoholic, drug addicted parents that constantly Mentally and Physically abused each other in front of me. I started drinking at 13, smoking weed at 14, and tried any drug I could get my hands on from 14-20. I am grateful that I was blessed enough to never experience homelessness, I always had food in the house and utilities were never shut off so I guess you could say it was semi-stable. When I turned 20, I got a call from my mom one night telling me that her and my father were at the hospital and he had just been diagnosed with Terminal Cancer and was given about 6 months to a Year to live. Now prior to this diagnosis of his, I had experience with numerous drugs but never felt like I was addicted to anything except the weed which I smoked daily from the ages of 14-20. About a week after my father being diagnosed, I was at home (moved back in with the folks to help mom get dad to his appointments) when my mom came in one day with a huge pill bottle of OxyContin. I had no idea that these pills would end up being the reason that the next 18 years of my life would be the most exhausting, depressing, anxiety ridden 18 years of my life. We went from living in an nice home to being evicted and living in my fathers plumbing shop that he ran his plumbing business out of for 30 years prior to getting sick. The next 2 years consisted of me getting high off pills, which eventually turned to heroin addiction, and then finally ending up with my father passing away in 2011. Shortly after his passing I was arrested and charged with 2 felony assault charges for a fight I was involved in which luckily ended with me pleading out to 1 felony assault charge as long as I could complete a 3 month inpatient treatment program, which I ended up successfully completing. Unfortunately, due to the bad decisions that I proceeded to make about 6 months after getting out of the treatment program, I was back into a full fledged drug addiction. It would take me another 13 years before I realized that from 2008-2024 I had only remained sober for approximately 6-9months total with 6 months being after the first inpatient treatment program and the other 3 months being a combo or either not being able to score drugs or by force due to a variety of reasons. So with all that said, I am proud to say that on January 8th I went into a detox program for the 3rd time in the last year, and instead of leaving after 2 or 3 days like the two previous attempts, I was actually able to complete the detox program and have been clean off of all illicit street drugs and alcohol since I went into the detox on the 8th of this month. During detox I was prescribed with Gabapentin, Seroquel, Buprenorphine, Librium and 2 separate doses of Ativan because of 2 days that I was having major anxiety to the point I felt like I was having a panic attack. When I completed the detox program and came home, I told myself that I was finally going to address all of the things that I had been using the opiates to numb my brain from feeling, and that I was going to finally get my life back. So what I did was go to a local clinic that prescribes medication to recovering addicts and I got in Buprenorphine to help with my opiate addiction and cravings that may arise over the next few years of my life while I‚Äôm reintegrating into society and learning to live life without getting high and being a depressed, hopeless, lonely person. Up until about 6 years ago, I never had ANY problems with anxiety. At least I didn‚Äôt think I ever did. In retrospect, I probably have always suffered from anxiety and just used drugs to cover up the feeling whenever I did feel like I was having any sort of anxious feelings. So I finally went into the doctor and talked to him about everything I just went through over the last few weeks. Oh, one thing I forgot is that about 3 months ago I got myself a new Primary Care doctor and told him what was going on and that I needed something to help with my anxiety. We talked about things that I have tried in the past which was only Hydroxyzine which made me very sleepy, Gabapentin which made me feel super lethargic, and so he prescribed me Propranolol, which unfortunately gave me bad stomach ache and really messed with my appetite. So yesterday, I had an appointment scheduled with him to talk about getting my Buprenorphine from him instead of having to go to the local clinic that I have been going to since this past Monday to get my Buprenorphine. He said that he would be happy to prescribe me with the Buprenorphine, but had a different option that he wanted me to consider which is called Sublocade. What Sublocade does is gives you a full month of Buprenorphine in your system through a 1 time monthly IV injection, and essentially makes it to where you don‚Äôt have to worry about taking a pill or multiple pills a day or have to go to a place like the clinic I have been going to everyday and you just take a shot once a month and you are good to go. I told him I‚Äôm open to this but I wanted to think about it a little more. He said that was completely fine and said he‚Äôd schedule me an appointment for next Thursday to take the shot, and then follow up  2 weeks after that to see how I was doing with the shot. Now I know that some people are probably wondering when the Clonazepam concern or questions come into the picture and that is right now. So I let the doctor know how my anxiety has been affecting me lately with all of this new medication and obligations that I have and everything that I‚Äôm trying to do to change my life for the better. I let him know about the Propranolol not working out and mentioned that back in the day I had a psychiatrist that I was working with that said from what I was describing to him and with my history that he was going to try me on a low dose of Clonazepam, but I never followed through with getting the script. So the doctor tells me that he is going to prescribe me 15 0.5mg pills of Clonazepam and that they should last me for 1 month. I am very confused about this though because he also tells me that I can take them as needed or take 1 pill up to 3 times a day for any anxiety. Well I have never had any experience with this type of medication, but yesterday when I left the pharmacy and picked up the prescription, I had to go to the clinic to get my Buprenorphine and when I got there it was crowded with people and it sent me into a huge panic attack and so I took 1 of the Clonazepam and within 5-10 mins I felt almost completely relieved of any anxiety that I was feeling. So my question is, since he said that 15 pills was supposed to last me 30 days, but then tells me that I can take them up to 3 times a day at a dose of 0.5mg, is there a right or wrong way to handle this situation? Because with me being in recovery I am not looking to abuse any kind of medication, but I really feel like this is the kind of anxiety relief that I‚Äôve been searching for for years and just never had the opportunity to try this medication. I just want to know how to approach this situation because part of me wants to tell him that I want to stay with this medicine, but I feel like with everything I am going to be going through over the next year, and all the things I have to catch up on in life and situations I‚Äôm going to be facing, I feel like having more of this medication than just the 15 pills a month he had given me will be beneficial and possibly help me from a relapse if things get too tough and I end up having more panic attacks and need to actually take a few of these pills daily. I know I just spilled my whole life story but I just hope someone can please help guide me from here or give me more information so I can assess my situation better and I know how to approach this moving forward. Thank you so much to anyone who takes the time to read all of this and offer me advice or anything that may be helpful. I am so grateful for anyone who has a response for me and may be able to help. God bless and I wish the best to everyone out there who may be struggling like I am right now. ",addiction

I spend another 2 hours in the gym each weekday and 2 hours each day on the weekend doing sports or jogging. I usually add another hour or two later in the day because it just feels weird not being in the gym.

Every time I see flabs of fat on my body, I want to cut my calories even further and push the amount of a deficit I can maintain as much as possible. No matter how much muscle I build it doesn't feel like enough because I am nowhere near my goal physique.

Frankly, even if he found a health problem I wouldn't really care that much because it still feels like I'm nowhere near losing weight or building muscle fast enough.

He asked if I need to see a counselor or something, but, he seemed to be hinting that I was bulimic.

We became friends again and I did stop cutting myself. I hated the attention it had brought me. I felt so empty. I started smoking weed and experienced my first panick attack. I kept smoking weed, I kept drinking. I was in high school when I met her. Her mom did cocaine, we did Cocaine. I missed a lot of school. I was quite drunk or high for most of my developing years. I got my first legal job at 17. I worked as much as I could. I started paying bills around the house. I felt helpful. I drank every night. 
I met him during high school. It started as a one night stand, but he had a car and knew how to get me off. I remember him calling me in the middle of the night for me to go meet him in his car and we'd go smoke weed and fuck until I had to be to school the next day. 
I started college a year after high school. I got worse then, but made good and bad friends. I fell in love, again. My love got arrested. I was 20 then. I moved back home and he moved in. We had been together the whole time. He became angrier. He would yell, he would scream at me day after day. Then he would hit me. I used to tell him no, but he would pin me. I stopped crying so long ago. I knew I didn't deserve anything else, not even death. 
I found out I was pregnant at 21. I hadn't gotten my period for 3 months. I still drank heavily. I even convinced my friend to cauterize a cut on his finger. I was 9 weeks when I was able to get my abortion. I had to go in for the vaginal ultrasound, there wasn't a heart beat. That broke me. I always wanted kids, but I couldn't have a child with this man, especially a dead one. I suffered alone with that. I bled and cried and drank and smoked. 
My mom left me. I was in and out of therapy. He hated when I went to therapy. I had a good counselor, but I fucked that up too when I tried to sleep with him. Part of me thinks I still would. I had always planned on killing myself. It never got better for so long. 
And then I met my lover. He showed me kindness my own mother couldn't. He gave me refuge and love. We fucked too, of course. I left my ex. I tried to. I packed my stuff and left to go be with my lover and his kids. 
And that's where I'm at today. Nearly 4-5 years later. Still in and out of therapy. Now on medications and now clean. Diagnosed with Barrets esophagus, non dysplasia, and PTSD, Depression, GAD and probably more. But the last few months I started using body soap and a loofah, in addition to my very few self care routines and now I use lotion on my bumpy arms. I go to the gym. I just graduated with my RN degree and have a high chance of passing my boards. I fell in love with caring for people when I became a CNA. I am surrounded by healthy animals who's bills I can afford. I have such a patient and loving man helping me navigate my crazyund and crazy past. I get frustrated with myself easily, and he reassures me constantly. It's not a perfect road for either of us. Lots of trial and error, especially getting me sober or navigating my moods. I talk to my family again and I miss them now. I see them more. I have good relationships with people. I did lose a lot of my old friends, but I had to. I am doing so much better, and of course I still fuck up and of course I still cry all the time, but I'm healing. I'm 28 and I should of been dead at 25. I do not want to kill myself. I just want to be a little better every year. 
Don't give in, never give up. It's tough. And I'm still fighting my head every day, nearly every second. But it does go silent at work. Or when I see the kids having a moment or when we go to fairs. It helps.",cocaine

1iv0adt,"In August 2024, I believe I had serotonin syndrome and am having lasting effects from it.",mentalillness,1740168409.0,4,1,"Hello. 31F. In August 2024, I got a new doctor, as my previous one left and I had not been taking my Zoloft like I should for several months(as my mother had passed and I had little ambition to do anything really). New Doctor prescribes all my meds again and I took them (I figured I took them befor, I would be fine). I slept maybe a few hours nd woke up and felt off. I tried to get back to sleep but I couldn't. I work nights as a healthcare worker. I go to work and felt okay but anxious and off. I chalked it up to I was tired. In the middle of the night, I get hit with a heat wave (best way I could describe it) and felt like I was going to pass out. My body got weak and I had to sit down. I felt confused and just not right at all. I called a family member and woke them up and stated ""I think I'm dying."" That's all I could say to them. It's the only way I could describe how I felt. I stared shaking and trembling and kept getting heat waves and sweating. I call work and inform them I need to leave. I get home by some miracle and the family member takes me to the ER. My B/P was high. I was trembling. Shivering. I went from cold to a wave of heat going through my body. Confusion. Felt like in a fog. Etc. They do all these tests and gave me benadryl shot. The ER thinks it was an allergy med (because it is basically like cocaine, their words). My friend immediately said it was the Zoloft and serotonin syndrome. I get released and still felt off, so I returned to the ER. They tell me the heat waves is GERD and send me home. I go to my dr and she feels awful because she didn't confirm with me if I had been taking my meds and said it was the Zoloft but keep taking it but lower dose. I do that for a bit, and I hated how I felt. I see her again and I tell her I hate the way I feel on it. I felt hot, anxious and sluggish all the time. So she prescribed Busiprone. I took that and it seemed to do fine. A few months later, I complain about my depression and she prescribed Effexor. I am TERRIFIED to take it. I did tell her this. She keeps encouraging me to take it. I feel like have such bad anxiety when it comes to taking ANY medication now. I still feel off and anxious. I feel like I have cognitive problems, eye problems now and other health concerns. I have expressed to my doctor a few times now my concerns and she gives me a strange look. I stated somwthing about serotonin syndrome and she said ""I don't know if it was that."" Because I told her I had a full blown panic attack last week due to my anxiety about everything. She continues to encourage me to take my meds but I am scared. My anxiety is so bad, I feel like I need to take something. I feel waves of anxiety consume me when I think of my concerns and what I'm feeling. I feel like I'm not being listened to. My boyfriend offers to take me to ER but I don't want to sit there for hours and it freaks me out what they might find as well. Like if it isn't from when I had that episode in August. I am not sure. I also suffered a concussion June 2024 (a few months before the August episode). so I am not sure if all of that did something. I just don't feel myself anymore. üòî I will be bringing everything up to my doctor again at my next appointment and try to be more assertive with my concerns and needing something done. I feel like it's all started after these events happened.

TL;DR - August '24 after not taking my Zoloft for several months (due to my mom passing and not wanting to do anything), my new dr prescribed my old dose and I took it (being an idiot) and came down with a slew of symtoms, felt like fainting, shivering, trembling, hot flashes, cold, etc. Go to the ER and they basically think it's an allergy med doing it (because it's like cocaine, their words). Go back a second time and they tell me its GERD. My dr has me continue the Zoloft for a few weeks and I finally tell her I can't keep taking it. Now on Busiprone and seems okay. She prescribed Effexor and I am too scared to take it or any med. But overall, I do not feel right. I still feel off and anxious all the time. I feel anxious because I feel so off. I feel anxious because of my concerns of my health. Cognitive issues, eye issues, feeling off, etc. Dr isn't really listening despite me voicing it. Will try to tell her again. Idk if it is long term effects or what is happing. I did also have a concussion in June '24. I feel like all started after these events.",cocaine

1ifsk1j,"My manifesto, i guess",mentalillness,1738483567.0,1,0,"Hi and thank you for reading whoever you are, whether online post or some other way. This may sound grand, or fake, or made up, but these are my thoughts and ideas so far in my life. Who am i? why do my thoughts matter? well i don‚Äôt think they do much, but maybe someone will. maybe in my desperate attempt to call into the void and get a response will prove some success.¬†Quickly to explain who i am, so this may make some better sense, i am 25 years old, male, American, and the only important thing at this moment is i do have schizophrenia, it is genetic and has plagued my family and now me. It is a mess or confusion, euphoria followed by a depression best described as dreadful and nuteral. Lastly i did endure what you call ‚Äúchildhood trauma.‚Äù only reason i speak of it like this is due to the current stigma around that term and the demographic that follows it and shouts it proudly. I despise those who make their life and whole person around pain and trauma. It is snake like. Nonetheless i will get into what this is, and explain more.¬†This is what you could call a manifesto. This is no call to action, or cry for help. Simply i have a lot going through my head, ways i see life, philosophy, the over-all human expierence.¬†to live is to suffer and to suffer is to live.. are the words i live by. Throughout my short 25 years on this floating rock in the abyss, i have learned and expierneced a great deal. More than i wish i had. Good things yes, bad things as well. now in my life im bitter, and intolerate of the world and people around me. i have goals and dreams, wants and desires, most not the same as many. however i feel in the base model of being i‚Äôm no different than anyone else walking this plane. I used to be social, and want friends, and to date and just be around people and life. Not anymore, i feel like a old man. wishing i could just sit in my house by the fire and read. or sit outside in a chair. i know for most may sound rather boring, but thats the point, you see? the calm, simple, peaceful stillness of ones body, all flowing as it should, breathe coming and out as natural as it can, the cool slight breeze against your face. This distant caw of some local bird. The sound of the leaves blowing by. The calm, the simple.¬†I partied, did drugs, drank, still drink and smoke weed. lots of weed. Alas no herion or oxycodone or codiene or cocaine. Nothing fun anymore. Now things are dead, and grey. all the colour and life sucked out. This though brings a thought to mind, about life and it‚Äôs purpose. We all find meaning and purpose in life differently. some in love, and nurturment. others in crime and do ill to others. and for the wide full view many in between. my life before stopping the drug use, was not this way. simply was not. instead my life was more, cheerful, and with some certainty that i could do something with my life. After i stopped, it all was lost. I am dejected, in a constant state of i don‚Äôt know where. i wish i was here, present. not even my video games, my enjoyment, can i just focus. Lockin for squad but no, instead im drifting. My fathers constant bullying me, and i mean bullying as in im the small kid on ths school yard. He is nice and kind at times, then others controlling, and when he doesn‚Äôt get his way he gets angry and says terrible things, and sometimes tries fight me, used to hit my mom.¬†For years this and how i was treated outside of home. People did not treat me well. And maybe rightfully so, as a kid and teen i was struggling with my mental illness. things were not easy. only by some grace i have some sanity, for sometime.¬†My mom and dad constant fighting, and my dad picking on me, making out like a little no body. My mom on the other hand has been the best, can‚Äôt say really anything negative.¬†now all this with the schizophrenia, and then drug use. Now i dont know what i am, or who i am. I don‚Äôt want to be here, alive. I wish i was dead. I‚Äôve tried to kill myself before and have failed everytime. guess what, like i fail most everything. i cant even kill myself right. Alas im still here. ‚Äúyou‚Äôre strong‚Äù ‚Äúoh what you‚Äôve been through most people die‚Äù i wish i had. what life is this. I know what i need to do, i know what i want. but whats the point. to be met with constant and utter disapointment time and time again. What did i do to deserve this? who did i hurt, or offend? what god? ill never know. ‚ÄúNate just do this and that and things will turn around‚Äù how? I understand certain things will change, but the things that matter, that hurt me. they just never go away? Well i have tried to fight it, and maybe im a coward. ill be king coward, lord of cowardess. i cant get over this feeling of abyss and gloom. I dont want to live, and as i do, id much rather have s woman, whom i love, and she loves me, i go through experiences, good and bad with her, grow a bond and love. is that too much? Ok second one is to be left alone. I dont want to go to family birthday parties, or to the concert, or the store. I want to be alone. Isolation. But i cant get it. i live with my mom, i dont live alone nor can i afford too. i cant be alone. Not only that my father still comes around, never escaping his destruction. ‚ÄúOh nate be more kind, go find friends, be more social, get out of your room‚Äù these things are not ways i wish to live. I wish to live simple and alone, not bothering anyone, or getting in the way. But no. i cant have this. and what life do i have anyhow? 25 no diploma, working at a hotel living with my mom. good things going, i have a drivers liscence. yes obviously there are my own faults here, things i can and could have done. What do i do now though. it seems others would like me to think its easy, no it isn‚Äôt. I dont think i will live, nor be sane to long. Im gods joke, born without a heart beat 3 months late, without my father who still to this day hates me. Got schizophrenia due to genetics, only to have a step dad if you will, come and destroy my mother, me and now he‚Äôs sad and boo hoo. i hate em simple. my lifes a joke. Im a joke. so the grand question i have is. why cant i just die? understand i should have been dead a number of times. i was even dnr (do not resesetate) and they did anyways. Why. Why me?i feel as if my world is closing in. i feel as if im just hallow, cursed to be the destoryed person rendered by my father and genetics. im smart, decently high iq, so problem solving is good. sure im not the brightest, but i hold my own. i love philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, and the occult. i wish, i could just be surronded by these things, books, artifacts, etc. and studying. eternally gather knowledge. that would be true peace. but guess what, cant have that either.¬†i have thought recently of killing myself again, but with fentanyl. sure fire way to do it, very potent, very toxic. But alas i dont know where to get any. so thats my 1 road block there.¬†i want to die. because everything i have, could, would or should expiernece in life is over for me, im good man. save and quit please. I speed run this game but cmon lemme out. let me have peace.¬†I wish i could have a wife, or even a chance with a woman, everyone says ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre tall, blues eyes brown hair like girls dig tall duds‚Äù bulllllllshit. They look at me like im fucking dracula. not the romantic dark kind either, the holy shit run kind.¬†I dont make friends well. i just sit in my room on the computer, or gaming. my dark ass room. Alone, execpt when my mother comes around.¬†Really the point of me saying all of this is this, i hate everyone and myself because my pereception at this point only goes there. And it truly does.i try everything not to feel this way. When someone does something to slight me, or hurt me, i do think of killing them. not because ‚Äú i want them dead‚Äù no more, you made me mad and i want to inflict pain on you and kill you. i want to see the life leave your eyes. i want to be the last face you see. my dead, cold face. I watch gore and other mixtapes regularly for the thrill, and wish that i was the one doing it, and hurting people. believe it or not i dont like feeling this way. it bothers me, but also i like it. to me its enjoyable to hurt others in ways i deem worthy. sometimes i hurt someone unintentionally, i do feel bad. but if i intend to no, in fact i get a weird desire to do it again and more. oh i cut that dudes brakes and put sugar in gas tank. boom kitty, hyper, sweating, euphoria rush, and then. the thought will come.. why not set his house on fire, let him fucking burn, his kids, and find a spot near by to listen to them scream. i do realize these are not normal or ‚Äúgood‚Äù things to think. but i mean at this stage in my life, ive been selfless, thrown around, beaten and dragged. i just have nothing left for anyone. my wishes remain but i know now thats what they are. Wishes, dreams. nothing more. im not cut out to have a normal life, to be normal. so instead i want to hurt people. not in a serial killer way. No because id get caught. No no i want to get into politics, business, finance, serious positions of power and set hell upon every single last person, woman, child, father or son, i care not, you will be empty and dead like me. if anything in life, if i can just have anything, if it isn‚Äôt my family not trying to destory each other, or me getting out of this hell fog im in. than it is simple. i will have my life the way i want. So i will do what i can to hurt people. some small, little things, building to bigger and greater. shaking hands with snakes, and making deals with devils. i have nothing, i am nothing, and i will make other nothing. maybe even you.¬†my occult studies and practices have given me some knowledge of a various things, that will aid in my hate quest if you will.¬†I only wish to do 1 thing, and 1 thing only. hurt you. scare you. make starved. make you beren. give you promises of all and deliver nothing. i want to give you fire, and let its never ending hunger devour you.¬†you a person no different than me, i hate you. know this, i will always hate you. i hate you for your flesh, bones, brain and organs, your personality, your dreams, your wants and desires, i hate it all but most of all i hate kayley fay jones, an ex of mine. Swear i have and will continue to do horrid things in the night to bend the will of her life to me, so i may destory her.¬†this is all i have for now. this is again my thoughts and ideas. i need to vent this out. take what i say how you will, but dont think of me as a liar or not genuine. i mean everything.

1iayrnf,Is love a mental illness? Here's my take,mentalillness,1737949064.0,1,1,"
With enough time and exposure, you can develop love or a deep fondness for almost anything, whether it's a person, a hobby, a place, or even a lifeless object, as familiarity and understanding build over time creating the sense of what we call love. Recent studies of brain scans show that being in love causes changes in the brain that are strikingly similar to serious mental health problems like drug addiction. 

Studies have shown that serotonin levels decrease during the early stages of ""love"", which is also seen in individuals with OCD, potentially explaining the extreme obsessive thinking associated with infatuation which often clouds the ability to think logically/long term. Serotonin is a hormone that the body produces naturally, and low levels can impact many bodily functions so when developing love for someone/something, you are essentially creating your own mental disease to a degree. 

Recent studies of brain scans show that being in love causes changes in the brain that are strikingly similar to serious mental health problems like hard drug addiction. 
Science shows that those ""in love"" experience a kind of high similar to that caused by illicit drugs such as cocaine which results in feelings of addiction/obsession leaving you in a vulnerable fragile mentality.

Socrates suggests that love is a form of divine madness. Plato once said, ‚ÄúLove is a serious mental disease,‚Äù and how true are those wise words. Love sickness isn't just a form of expression for those head-over-heels, but has been studied as an actual illness.

1g41fqq,I ‚Äúoverdosed‚Äù on THC and went into psychosis  ,mentalillness,1728973747.0,19,4," I am (16)M and this happened last year after I had turned 16. I‚Äôm t this at the risk of my future I‚Äôm petrified that the government will find this when I try to join the military and deny my entry, so I will only be referencing what it was a few times.  

I was at school and my friend let me hit is dispensary cart and I was/am an avid smoker, however after I used his, something else happened. I don‚Äôt know if this was a result of it being amplified because of my anxiety levels or something but it was terrifying. 

After I hit his thing the bell rung and I made my way to class, I started to feel weird and then I was in third person and I couldn‚Äôt read or write anything I just assumed I was too high so I just tried to calm myself down by shaking my leg but then I realized I was moving my whole desk by how hard I was shaking my leg. I got up to use the restroom and sat in the corner of the stall on the floor disassociating for maybe 15 minutes then decided I needed to go back to class. I felt pretty alright walking back but when I reached the door to my class and I went for the handle into the room my stomach grew a pit and my heart rate increased and I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to open the door. I waited for a few minutes and sipped some water in the hall and finally toughed it out. 

This is when it got bad 

When I went in (it was 1st period and it was an ap class so there was only 9 people including myself and the teacher) so it was really quiet, I was still extremely anxious but I figured i could thug it out until the bell rang. I didn‚Äôt think to look at the time but I tried asking the teacher when we got out but when I said it aloud nobody moved a muscle, and when I say that I mean everybody literally froze, nobody moved then I got this piercing noise and realized it was the chairs from 2 classrooms over getting moved. I started to freak out so I spoke a little louder and nobody moved, I got up from my desk and started repeating ‚Äúno no what the fuck what‚Äôs going on‚Äù and when I stood up my vision was covered by these black figures, in hindsight I think i was really lighted headed and my vision was going in and out but in the moment and for months after I was convinced these were entities and in the moment they took the shape of people and they were everywhere. Then I blinked and everybody was staring at me so I moved to the front of the class asked for a note, and left the class, everybody at this point was staring at me like I was crazy. As I was walking to the nurses still in the most panicked state I‚Äôve ever been the bell rung and I panicked even more. I walked through the staff entrance and immediately asked for the nurses attention, credit where it is due they helped me very very kindly. 

I sat in the nurses chair for a bit and described what had been happening but as I was sitting there after they questioned me a bunch still ina very petrified state I looked at them and asked a question. The same thing happened as it did the in the classroom and they didn‚Äôt move, nobody moved a muscle I got up and went to the desk but I kept my distance and they still didn‚Äôt look, I was so scared I started to yell. I ran into this small room where they held snacks and I sat down in the corner and was staring at the door, muttering, I was so scared of these people that I couldn‚Äôt deal with them coming into the room so i backed as far 
Agasint the wall as possible. I don‚Äôt remember coming out of this room but the next thing I do is the principal, nurses, and school counselor surrounding me in the chair I was previously at, I couldn‚Äôt deal with this either, panicked again and headed for the door, I went outside and the school counselor followed me. 

When I was outside he began to speak to me and I couldn‚Äôt hold it in, everything that I had been struggling with came out, I admitted to thinking i had BPD (I‚Äôm not diagnosed I‚Äôve just done a lot of personal research and am scared a diagnosis will fuck up my life) and I explained what it was and why I think I had it. And he stared at me like I was stupid and he said made me feel ignorant about it all. I moved on from that and started ranting about pride and undiagnosed autism. This went on for a while and I just talked to him, eventually I calmed down but when I did I was in this state of being where I wasn‚Äôt in my body and everything felt like a dream, but I felt super calculated and extremely smart. We brought me back inside and he sat me in one of those beds that people sit who are sick at school lay in, but during our conversation I had drastic mood swings and would change my subject constantly, I started talking about how I loved my ex but didn‚Äôt want to date her because she wasn‚Äôt elevated to my level of being, my counselor reinforced this idea a few times during this experience, talking about how I was chosen for something and it tripped me out and i still despise myself for these moments and am petrified of being a narcissist because of them. Eventually I was brought to the Principals and then home, my dad and mom were so mad my dad almost resorted back to old punishments, and claimed I was either gonna end up dead or in prison like my uncles. I didn‚Äôt feel like myself for the coming weeks and I wrote in this journal for hours and hours, previously I had never journaled but I wrote these passages about commandments and how to elevate yourself and become the person you were meant to by, I still have the pages if anybody would like to see them, they‚Äôre crazy and I think I destroyed a few of them because my sister tried to open the book. I know I can‚Äôt ever go back to being who I was before this experience. 

I‚Äôve never told anybody this complete story and if you made it this far thank you for taking the time to read about my experience. At this point in my life I‚Äôm pretty sure I have BPD after researching hyper specific symptoms I have, the results on google, Reddit, and personal conversation all lead me to believe I have BPD but I know a self diagnosis can be a dangerous thing which is why I still do not make the claim I have BPD, I am just leaning towards that claim. I feel like I‚Äôm splitting as of right now and I‚Äôm trying not to give in to the thoughts about relapse But that could realistically just be in my head. ",overdose

I started doing involuntary facial movements, my thoughts were racing in my mind 24/7, and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe and was gasping for air. While I also experienced some ‚Äúpositive‚Äù effects, like feeling more real than I‚Äôve had for an eternity, probably the worst part of it all were the incredible mood swings. I literally had all types of emotions 5 times a day alternating with an immense power. It always went like this: I was ok, then I started getting angry, then fell into absolute despair, and then felt a lightness and calmness that I‚Äôve rarely known. And this repeated over and over again. Until one day, the despair phase was so intense that I almost did something bad to myself. After that (until then I thought I just had to push through the withdrawal), I gave up and started taking the med again. Almost immediately, I was back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.

I‚Äôm fairly new to this job too so that doesn‚Äôt help and it‚Äôs very fast paste I‚Äôve done this type of work but with the help of adderal. Help!?,withdrawal

I'm tired and I'm just done trying I'm not selfish I've been strong to long. ,end my life
1fjz89o,"I cannot deal with this anymore, I'm close to ending my life",mentalillness,1726682351.0,3,3,"I posted yesterday about how I'm planning to isolate myself from the world on account of my deep issues when it comes to ""beauty"", to prevent myself from doing anything I will regret . Since then I've been thinking, and I'm not sure what to do anymore. 

To explain: always been absurdly obsessive about appearances. As in, I cannot mentally cope with or align with atypical thinking on appearances. It drives me up the fucking wall. I often get irrationally angry over the sheer thought of ugly people existing, and I have panic attacks when I try and do things that my mind has decided to irrational consider as being ""infected by the presense of ugly people"". This ranges from basically everything in my life, including fundamental things like eating, and even sleeping (I'm hugely insomnactic due to this reason). For most of my life I've mistaken my issues for some sort of extreme form of a cacophobia disorder, but in recent years I've come to understand my issues more ""clearly"" (or to be accurate, what it ISN'T more clearly), although that's only made them worse. 

I think the worst part about my problems have to be these two things, though:

1. Nothing identifiable--not really having any semblance of logic or consistency--not even in a way that is non-neurotypical, yet still has some thread of consistency to it
2. People just not believing this is a real thing, because I cannot explain it that clearly
3. The absolute ridicule I get from all sides, because everyone thinks I'm just a narcissist with a made up mental illness

Really, I want to say that ""the actual issues I have isn't the worst part, it's the fact that no one listens to them or cares about them"", but those two things have just blurred together now and I cannot even tell them apart. No one takes me the least bit seriously, and the dissonance between how insincerely people always treat my problems, and how sincerely suffocating they feel, is driving me to the brink. I've begun to sincerely limit every form of contact I have, and I'v got nothing left in my life.

I'm at the end of my rope here. I turn 30 in around a week, and I've always promised myself I'd end my life before I turn 30, since I hate the idea of getting older and ""uglier""--but even that's a scary prospect for me, and as I've been getting closer to the date, I've just gone back on it, because I can't stop thinking stuff like ""what if there IS something after death"", and I also worry about what happens to my body when I'm gone.

I just don't know what to do. Therapy doesn't work, isolation only makes me feel worse, yet it's all I seem to have. 

What's making this all worse, yet still, is that I'm also currently being plagued by countless physical issues--which are partly due to my past of severe self-starvation, and other such things. I really just don't know what to do. No road seems open to me, at all. ",end my life
1epynz5,How the hell did I end up becoming the same thing as my father when we had such different paths in life?????,mentalillness,1723418731.0,1,1,"My father grew up without any love whatsoever.

Cool. My ass was raised by a very loving mother who'd pamper me with hugs and kisses on a daily basis. She's always cared for me and did everything she could to build a stable household for me.

1e3o998,"21, memory problems are making me feel like my life's ended before it's even began",mentalillness,1721026320.0,0,3,"To preface, I've had depression since as far back as my freshmen year of high school. It used to be worse, but it's cleared up somewhat since this year; I'm generally pretty happy and rarely have relapses where I really get into my own head, but I do still struggle to find the motivation to pursue any of my goals, mostly wasting my time playing video games and watching TV. I've also had anxiety for a few years, which manifests mainly as health anxiety. I used to worry about the usual things, cancer, heart problems, a lot of physical ailments, but nowadays I pretty much exclusively worry about Alzheimer's, dementia, and just about any form of irreversible cognitive disease.

Originally, I used to really pick apart small lapses in memory and things like mixing up my words, which I could easily brush aside and ignore by telling myself everyone has moments like that, but, in the last few months, it feels as if I have really manifested this thing I've been most afraid of. I find myself really flubbing my words all the time now, mixing two words or syllables or swapping in a similar word rather than the one I want; I'm also really concerned with how often I just completely blank on words or names. I used to be so sharp and eloquent in school and now I sometimes just have to stop speaking mid-sentence because I simply can not think of the information I need to finish my thought. I tried not to pay this much mind, but I've found myself being unsure of and incorrectly recalling things I feel I should never forget.

The other day, I couldn't think of the name of the kid's show Sesame Street, a show I watched so much when I was younger and have talked about countless times. I could think of the characters on the show, Elmo, Oscar, Big Bird, etc. but it took me almost 30 seconds to finally recall the word Sesame. Yesterday, I was trying to talk about different types of bottled water and wanted to say the name 'Fiji', but the name that came to mind instead was 'Fuji', which I knew was wrong as soon as I said it, but it wasn't until I looked it up that the real name clicked. Today, I tried to think of how many letters are in the English alphabet and the number that came to mind was fucking 27. I knew that didn't sound right, so I counted on my fingers and couldn't help but break down into tears when the number was 26. Who the hell forgets how many letters are in their one and only mother tongue?!?

And what really gets me is, yes, mental illnesses like depression and anxiety can cause memory problems, but only short-term and working memory, so stuff like having trouble retaining new information and forgetting what you did the day before, and this happens mainly when you are actively distressed. These are not instances of short-term or working memory problems I've been having and I have not been actively anxious or depressed when they happen, this is my fundamental memory recall and long-term memory getting worse and worse. It's making me embarrassed to even talk with my friends and coworkers. I feel like each day I'm going to wake up to find it's become just a little harder to remember things, until, one day, it gets so bad someone has to confront me. I'm 21 years old and I'm going to have the brain of a 90 year old before I can start my career, buy a house, and start a family. If my doctor have confirmed my suspicions, I don't think I could continue a life so hopeless. I just don't know what to do.",end my life
1cpjhqm,"I'm bipolar I, severe anxiety and PTSD. It seems like I create chaos in my life or get into situations that end badly. Is this relatable?",mentalillness,1715439871.0,0,0,"This is a throwaway account. This is a very unusual situation so please read before any judgments or shaming. Let me start by saying that I have had a best friend for quite a few decades (the dynamic has change due to recent events) and I have been close to her husband whom I have known just slightly longer. I even dated her husband in high school before she did. Another side note for reasons that will be explained later in the post, I have bipolar 1 disorder, severe anxiety and PTSD.

While we were dating (I was 15 and he was 16) he told me he loved me and wanted to marry me. It really freaked me out, because I WAS 15! I told him to go away to which I now know was a stupid kid mistake. He and my best friend married soon after we all graduated from high school, and I ended up marrying someone else. I was in love with him but at the time we were both married to different people. He and my ex both went into the military and moved away. We did not see each other for a long time.

Fast forward to 2019. I fell on some hard times and they allowed my son and I to move in with them for what was supposed to be very temporary, but ended up being almost 5 years. When I moved in he barely spoke to me so I figured he pretty much hated me and I kept my distance. That went on for about 2 years.

By this time, my friend and her adult daughter went on many trips for weeks and sometimes months at a time, leaving my son, my friend's husband and myself alone all of those times. Naturally we got close again. We ended up sleeping together. We talked a lot and found out that we both were still in love with each other, thus progressing into a full blown affair. I have been single for many years. He and my friend have been married for decades.

He and I talked at length about what this meant for us. No matter when I move out, we would continue to see each other as often as possible. This is where part of the dynamic changes. We are all moving out of the house we are renting, and they are going to live in my friend's father's home as her dad recently passed. I am not moving into the house with them.

The other part of the dynamic is that this move was very sudden and put me into a bind with nothing saved up for deposits, etc. My friend, to which we are no longer friends. She and I have been fighting about money due to my limited funds, I am unable to save anything if I am paying her the full rent which was a ridiculous amount to pay in the first place. I am having to get a second job to help with my costs.

This extra job and the fact that this man works remote from home, makes is impossible to see each other at all. Anyone who has or knows someone who has Bipolar understands that emotions are extreme and there is no gray area.

I had asked him if he would divorce his wife to be with me, and he has said no but also says he isn't sure why. He has said he would fight for me and yet he won't divorce. He says he just wants to make the best of the time we have left. I am already breaking down, and I seriously don't know how I am going to get past this.

He has a hard time showing emotion, and I am aware of this. But sometimes it feels like he doesn't care and can easily go back to the way life was before we started our affair, almost like it never happened. I am really losing it and my heart is shattered. Does this situation sound like it's my fault for getting involved even though I didn't know it was going to end?",end my life

I go out for a walk for 2 hours per day, and 3+ hours per day on the weekend. I don‚Äôt really feel relaxed enough to enjoy the surroundings, I just need to maintain in a state of walking, and when I‚Äôm walking I can feel a bit better. 

I‚Äôm talking about these but these are really just trifles in life. What I care about the most everyday and every moment is: when and how I will die. For so many times I picture that crucial moment, perhaps I‚Äôll take fentanyl, perhaps cut my neck and wrist. And nobody will know I died until my body begins to smell. Maybe my boss will find out after I miss 2 meetings. Maybe my awful landlord will be freaked out, that‚Äôs perfect. Maybe friends will start realizing I‚Äôm gone after half year to two years, but won‚Äôt be too worried as this matches my behavioural pattern. How about the people who have to take care of the body? Perhaps it‚Äôs the same when homeless people died. 
I want to die when I‚Äôm still able to afford the rent, and still employed. Why? Ain‚Äôt the result the same? It sounds like I‚Äôm not trying hard enough, not trying hard until I lose everything and strapped naked on the street. But I thought this is quite proper for my ending, on a proper bed, bill paid, warm and clean. 

Here my dear reader, you might want to suggest me to create some hobbies, go out socializing, get a therapist (sorry no insurance) read some self help books, or yoga, meditation. I assure you it has been a long battle full of these tryings in the past two years. Among those the habit what stayed, as I just mentioned, are addiction and 2 hours aimless walk. I learned about trauma, ptsd, dream reading, our beloved carl jung, New York best sell psychology book..although none of them give me any desire to live. 
My ex‚Äôs gf suggested me anti-depressants as she is on it right now. As I don‚Äôt have health card or insurance that anything can help me pay, I guess I dont mind have a try of hers if she ever wants to meet up. 

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm still alive, guessing i still fear that moment of death. It‚Äôs funny I‚Äôm not afraid of pain I‚Äôm just afraid of that moment of decease. 

My dear remote therapeutic coworker recently introduced me an idea of victimization ‚Äî That I think I‚Äôm a victim of my own life. That actually sounds right as you read what I have wrote above. I‚Äôm ruling off all other options except for one path toward self destruction. Have I really tried to help myself? Do I really want to change? Maybe not. And I‚Äôm sure if I don‚Äôt help myself, nobody will do. Even I think I want to, my subconscious mind fights it. How can I entirely, fully, from head to toe, from heart to soul Want to change my pathetic life? How can I want to live? Maybe I need a taste of death then. 

Today I‚Äôm sunking in the couch for the whole day mostly not sober. Drugs and addiction no longer gives me the same distraction. I feel old, as though I really did reach the end of my life. I thought it‚Äôs funny, a life without family, it was exciting, colourful even thrilling. Im actually content and I‚Äôve experienced enough.",end my life

I thought our relationship would be great- we got along really well as friends. He was so sweet to me. I fell in love with him. Well 5 months later, it's been a nightmare 60% of the time. We are toxic together. He had an awful dad and now has cPTSD and bipolar 1 disorder. He is quick to anger, especially with me. He isn't abusive but when he gets angry, it's over very little e.g. me forgetting to buy toothpaste, and he'll avoid me all day and on two occassions, he has totally lost it and called me various insults. His cold nature triggers me. I find myself crying at least twice a week over his aloof nature. It hurts so bad. While I had a much happier childhood, I have OCD and depression and its worsening these.

I don't really want to break my lease. It's hard to find accommodation in my college city and I still have 5 months left of grad school. Beyond that, I like the house and I get along with everyone (bar him at the minute). And my landlord will definitely not give me mt deposit back if I break it. I'm sick of hurting. It will hurt to leave but giving up will hurt less in the long run. He can't disappoint me anymore. How do I end this delicately? I want to end it while he's calm",end my life

14nj2oy,I was going to kill myself today,mentalillness,1688177928.0,38,378,"When I was 8, I was raped by 2 teenagers. Multiple times. They told me they were going to kill my family. I was terrified. So I didn't fight them the time after that, or the many other times that followed. The rapes only stopped because my mom couldn't pay the rent and we had to move. 
When I was in middle school, my mother had taken too many prescription pills and totaled our only car with my brother in it. My mother was arrested and my brother was fine. I missed my mom when she was in jail. She got released a week later. She got back on schedule with her medications. 
And then I remember begging her to be part of this family, because she had been abusing her meds again. 
I started drinking in middle school. I didn't stop. We had many pets, and in that sense I watched many of my pets due to not being able to afford vet care. I remember when we lost power on Christmas week and we froze all week. I remember boiling water to bathe and dumping water outside of my bathroom window because the tub wouldn't drain. 
I started cutting myself in middle school. Everyone thought it was because me and my friend had a falling out because my mother attacked her father. 
We became friends again and I did stop cutting myself. I hated the attention it had brought me. I felt so empty. I started smoking weed and experienced my first panick attack. I kept smoking weed, I kept drinking. I was in high school when I met her. Her mom did cocaine, we did Cocaine. I missed a lot of school. I was quite drunk or high for most of my developing years. I got my first legal job at 17. I worked as much as I could. I started paying bills around the house. I felt helpful. I drank every night. 
I met him during high school. It started as a one night stand, but he had a car and knew how to get me off. I remember him calling me in the middle of the night for me to go meet him in his car and we'd go smoke weed and fuck until I had to be to school the next day. 
I started college a year after high school. I got worse then, but made good and bad friends. I fell in love, again. My love got arrested. I was 20 then. I moved back home and he moved in. We had been together the whole time. He became angrier. He would yell, he would scream at me day after day. Then he would hit me. I used to tell him no, but he would pin me. I stopped crying so long ago. I knew I didn't deserve anything else, not even death. 
I found out I was pregnant at 21. I hadn't gotten my period for 3 months. I still drank heavily. I even convinced my friend to cauterize a cut on his finger. I was 9 weeks when I was able to get my abortion. I had to go in for the vaginal ultrasound, there wasn't a heart beat. That broke me. I always wanted kids, but I couldn't have a child with this man, especially a dead one. I suffered alone with that. I bled and cried and drank and smoked. 
My mom left me. I was in and out of therapy. He hated when I went to therapy. I had a good counselor, but I fucked that up too when I tried to sleep with him. Part of me thinks I still would. I had always planned on killing myself. It never got better for so long. 
And then I met my lover. He showed me kindness my own mother couldn't. He gave me refuge and love. We fucked too, of course. I left my ex. I tried to. I packed my stuff and left to go be with my lover and his kids. 
And that's where I'm at today. Nearly 4-5 years later. Still in and out of therapy. Now on medications and now clean. Diagnosed with Barrets esophagus, non dysplasia, and PTSD, Depression, GAD and probably more. But the last few months I started using body soap and a loofah, in addition to my very few self care routines and now I use lotion on my bumpy arms. I go to the gym. I just graduated with my RN degree and have a high chance of passing my boards. I fell in love with caring for people when I became a CNA. I am surrounded by healthy animals who's bills I can afford. I have such a patient and loving man helping me navigate my crazyund and crazy past. I get frustrated with myself easily, and he reassures me constantly. It's not a perfect road for either of us. Lots of trial and error, especially getting me sober or navigating my moods. I talk to my family again and I miss them now. I see them more. I have good relationships with people. I did lose a lot of my old friends, but I had to. I am doing so much better, and of course I still fuck up and of course I still cry all the time, but I'm healing. I'm 28 and I should of been dead at 25. I do not want to kill myself. I just want to be a little better every year. 
Don't give in, never give up. It's tough. And I'm still fighting my head every day, nearly every second. But it does go silent at work. Or when I see the kids having a moment or when we go to fairs. It helps.",kill myself

Even from an anonymous account without my real name on Reddit, I feel deeply ashamed and find it incredibly hard to express myself.

Guys, I‚Äôve been fighting this for over a week, barely overcoming my fear, and finally decided to share what I‚Äôve created. To be honest, today I almost buried my idea again, as always, because of my crippling self doubt

In short, I‚Äôve created and trained an AI agent that performs mental health screenings.

But first, some backstory, please read it, I‚Äôll try to keep it short

Since my childhood I‚Äôve been extremely withdrawn kid. On the one hand, I‚Äôve always felt like there‚Äôs a strong personality inside me, but I‚Äôve spent my entire life doubting myself and fearing society. I‚Äôve struggled with depression and still don‚Äôt fully understand how I avoided suicide.

My childhood, by the way, was good, that‚Äôs probably what saved me. My mom loved and cared for me. There wasn‚Äôt any emotional connection with my father, and he eventually left our family. 

It shattered my confidence and social anxiety became unbearable. I couldn‚Äôt even speak to people, I can‚Äôt emphasize enough how hard was socializing. 

When I was 19 I lost 3 family members, they all passed away in very short period. Only reason I‚Äôm alive is my mother, I just couldn‚Äôt give up and hurt her after her parents and brother passed away so fast.

As an adult, I‚Äôve had moments when I forced myself to be more open, playing the role of a confident and outgoing person. But some people could still sense my vulnerability, even when I tried to act naturally.

Drugs and alcohol were the only things that helped me feel open, but they nearly ruined my life. My willpower was completely shattered, and even now, it‚Äôs barely holding on.

I never truly escaped this state. I sleep as much as possible every day and do everything to avoid problems and reality. I can‚Äôt keep living like this anymore. These suicidal thoughts are eating me up inside.

So recently I decided to create an AI agent for mental health screening. Just trying to feel even a small sense of purpose in my life and help both myself and others

Because of my doubts, social anxiety, and lack of confidence, I nearly killed this idea like all ideas before.

It's nothing about him, he's not a hero, he hasn't been through a lot, but it's the pain scale that really impresses me.

Despite the fact that he loses his sanity to the point where he can barely even move anymore, despite the fact that he's hallucinating or that he's had a claw made of fingers as sharp as knives which scratched him, he still crawls, or moves, regardless. He doesn't give up.

And even though there are heroes in this world much stronger than him who cut themselves to the point that their wounds bleed like cuts made by a creature, Daniel feels like somebody else to me.

He's probably the strongest person I know of from a game, which is also a realistic game. For example...

You could say Steve from Minecraft is insanely strong because even if he has half a heart (which is equivalent to probably several severed limbs, he still can run), but it...

Isn't realistic.

So when I think about the fact that he goes through much more pain than me and is still able to crawl, I say to myself that even if the pain I go through feels like somebody slamming a chair into me constantly, I can still crawl when I am unable to move.

1dffpfh,My fianc√© is hiding my medication from me,mentalillness,1718330134.0,70,83,"
I could use some help navigating this situation, please.

My (26f) fianc√© (33m), together a total of over 4 years, are getting married this August. We have a 2.5 year old son as well.

I am diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, Post Traumatic Stress disorder, and obesity.

My fianc√© is diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. 

My family has extensive history of mental health disorders and my childhood was traumatic. 

I've always had issues, but they got worse after having my baby and I was finally receiving extra care through a postpartum program so I received medications for the first time. An antipsychotic and an antidepressant. I took those for about a year and a half, and they helped me a lot. Things weren't perfect, but I was much more level headed and capable of facing life's challenges.

Well, around last fall my fianc√© decided he can't stand me on medication. He never loved the idea, but he really started to hate it then. I gained 30lb from the antipsychotic and that was certainly part of his concern. Now I'm 40lb heavier than when we got together.

Over the course of many months, he would guilt me every day about being ""drugged"" and ""dependant"" and encourage me to come off of my medication. He believes that I'm being manipulated by ""big pharma"" and prescribed something that I don't really need. 

I consulted a psychiatrist and they didn't support me coming off of my meds but helped me do it anyway.

I've been off of all of my meds for a month and a half and GUYS it is not. going. well.

My mood swings are incredible, I'm agressive and mean, violent, having insane manic episodes, spent literally all of my money (financially dependant on him now... I'm a full time student who doesn't work), and also miserable depressive episodes. I also had a 4.19 GPA in school, but this semester I am failing. 


My fianc√© believes that if I: Have proper sleep, eat half my maintenance calories, and exercise, among other healthy habits, then my mental health issues would be resolved. Believe me when I tell you that he puts IMMENSE guilt and pressure on me every day to push these things on me. 

My mom, his mom, my siblings, my friends, my therapists (I have 2), my family doctor, and myself all believe that I need to be medicated.

He says he refuses to marry someone who is ""on drugs"" and has given me that ultimatum. 
I had a very scary manic episode last week and I reached for my antipsychotic, and he wrestled it from my hands, spilling it all over the floor. He picked them up and hid the bottle from me, and refuses to tell me where it is. 

Yes, I know these are red flags, but please remember that he has Asperger's syndrome, and that I am putting him through hell too. He cries every day from the stress of dealing with my mood swings. But he believes it will get better without medication. I don't. 

My question is, how can I navigate this situation? How can I convince him that this medication is not a ""drug"", it's literal medicine to ease the symptoms of my very real conditions? How can I convince him that these intense symptoms are not only withdrawal? And how can I convince him that all those cruxes of health that are ever so important to him that I achieve cannot be accomplished or even worked on while I am struggling just to stay sane?

1iq9xsy,Has anybody lived through serotonin syndrome?,mentalillness,1739649798.0,28,9,"I think I gave myself serotonin syndrome. I won't describe what exactly gives me that idea but I am 99% sure what I took gave me serotonin syndrome.

This was around wednesday night. I didn't call an ambulance because it was my own fault, and I had decided early on into the longest, most hellish night of my life, that I would rather die than live, having the embarrassment of being taken into hospital due to a one off stupid moment. I imagined my parents finding out, and the disappointment on their faces. I imagined work finding out. I imagined the new life I had worked so hard to create, just being washed away. I couldn't let myself live in a world like that. So I wrote a letter to whomever, in case I didn't make it through, and I just sat there, struggling to breathe, my heart pumping through my chest. Collapsing every time I tried to stand, my face red and flushed. My mouth dry as a bone. Hallucinating, confused, crying, begging with unknown entities. Bargaining with the universe- please don't let me need to go to hospital. I can't cope with the embarrassment. I can't do this. 

For whatever reason, I made it through. I finally slept after two nights of this, and I've settled down a lot. However, my vision is still quite blurred and I still have to catch my breath every now and again. My muscles keep stiffening up, I feel this most when I'm lying down still. I keep needing constant hydration, too.

I can't describe how bad that night was. I am still unsure how I survived. I keep switching from relief that I didn't die and let down everyone, to panic that I've done serious damage, to just generalised post- traumatic stress of the incident. I'm wondering if I am actually through it or if I've done something to myself that can't be cured without medical intervention. Curious if anybody has experienced anything similar? ",i cant go on

I have a history of depression as well as SH, which has been going on longer than this addiction. I'm not going to get into that because of guidelines and such, but I am just trying to paint a bit of picture here. I am not a violent person at all, I hate violence and I hate that people do it in the first place, I am not at all what people would think of when they think of someone who watches these videos but here I am. Every time I end up back on those sites, I watch one video and it just snowballs, just today I spent 3 hours watching this stuff and I hate myself for it because I gained nothing positive at all. I can assure anyone that may be wondering that this is not a fetish, I am not aroused by this and I absolutely never will be, I just feel like I might need to point that out. I don't know why these videos keep pulling me in, they just make me feel worse and it leaves me in a silence that lasts a couple of minutes. I feel so terrible after watching these videos that I can't look at anything but the wall, and I usually start bawling my eyes out and feeling overly stressed.

1iaqqq1,Anyone know what mental illness this is?,mentalillness,1737926351.0,27,13,"I don‚Äôt have schizophrenia but my psychiatrist doesn‚Äôt know what I have. I also don‚Äôt know if I have psychosis, my current diagnosis is ‚Äúunspecified psychotic disorder‚Äù. I‚Äôm not seeing or hearing anything others don‚Äôt, but my interpretation of reality is entirely fucked up, and I‚Äôve been aware of it for months and actively working on it but nothing seems to help. I‚Äôm taking anti psychotics but they don‚Äôt help, I think I‚Äôm going to be trapped in the hell my mind created forever.

My issue is I took a ton of psychedelics and never snapped out of it. My life is a permanent trip right now. The crazy perspectives and off feelings about the fabric of reality itself‚Ä¶ you know the trips you come back from with a sigh of relief‚Ä¶ yea. I never came out of it. That‚Äôs my life today.

The thing about me is I‚Äôm very self aware that these aren‚Äôt reality. But I worry as time passes I‚Äôll get more and more stuck in it. This has been the most frightening experience of my entire life. I feel like nobody else will ever understand me, and feel like killing myself just to end the confusion. But I don‚Äôt feel quite schizophrenic or psychotic. To be honest, it‚Äôs given me a whole new perspective on everything. To see just how invested everyone is in their life when reality is SO FUCKING WEIRD. Like, we all intellectually understand that, but there is a mental block that doesn‚Äôt allow you to truly digest just how strange it is that we‚Äôre all here. Shrooms and psychedelics tend to break that block. I‚Äôm sure you all know what I mean‚Ä¶ that ‚Äúrealer than real‚Äù feeling that after you take it  that scares you so much you swear you‚Äôll never take it again because it was so reality shattering but then you end up taking it again because you forget how strange it was, you only realize it in the moment when you‚Äôre high on shrooms or whatever it was.

Well, that mental barrier made for our survival has been broken for me, and I absolutely can see why that filter has been put up in the first place because I‚Äôm constantly questioning reality because I truly understand just how strange it is. EVERY FUCKING MOMENT. Like I no longer have that filter that makes me want to grind and go. I feel like I‚Äôm no longer an active participant in reality. I‚Äôm not motivated by human desires anymore. I used to be such a high achiever. It‚Äôs like I woke up and now that I woke up from the dream and my perspective broadened, I realize how much I took for granted my whole life my naivety and just taking reality for what it was and not questioning it. I fucking miss that so bad. I feel like I‚Äôm not even alive anymore. Imagine all the barriers that get taken down on psychs were permanently down for you. It‚Äôs literally fucking torture. 

Ontop of that, I feel as if objects can perceive me back. They seem to have this threatening energy about them. Obviously it‚Äôs not true and I‚Äôll sit there and be so angry with myself for seeing them that way, but I can‚Äôt shake it. I‚Äôm so terrified too it‚Äôll get into something worse but it seems like in my research NOBODY experiences this?? Like this is not a common phenomenon and I feel so alone :( and my body tenses up all the time in anticipation of feeling like these objects can perceive me back, because I‚Äôm experiencing them as an actual threat for some reason. So it‚Äôs like my body learned to be on edge constantly. I never get a break.

I feel like I‚Äôm not in reality also‚Äî this happened later after I think just so much disassociation and derealization that came from the trauma of this whole ordeal. I truly believe that I belong somewhere else. This. Does. Not. Feel. Like. Reality. To. Me. It‚Äôs like I wake up from my dreams at night into another dream (reality) never waking up to my true self. This just feels so fucking fake, a part of me just knows it‚Äôs fake, but actual me knows I‚Äôm just going crazy and this is real. I don‚Äôt have any experience being anywhere but reality (obviously) but it‚Äôs like my mind somehow remembers being somewhere else? It doesn‚Äôt know what that place is, it just knows. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it, it‚Äôs something a part of me just accepted as truth for literally NO FUCKING REASON. I have tried to do parts work with this part and it will NOT LET UP despite having no evidence

‚Äî
Edit: after talking to chatGPT as my therapist with the voice feature, she asked me to try and visualize this other place as best I could. I realized it was a void where the air felt so clear and crisp, I could feel it on my skin. I felt truly and utterly real here and just knew on a deep level this is it. My subconscious isn‚Äôt fully convinced of it, but we came to the conclusion that this other place isn‚Äôt a real place, it‚Äôs a manifestation of my mind wanting to return to the way I used to feel about REAL reality because my perception right now is so overwhelmed and everything in real reality feels fake. Realizing that made me cry because I think it‚Äôs probably exactly what‚Äôs happening even though it still feels like a very real place to me. Just in case someone with similar issues reads this in the future, just wanted to point out this may be what‚Äôs going on with you too :)
‚Äî

And that‚Äôs just a persistent thought I know is false but I can‚Äôt break, it‚Äôs so fucking terrifying and every second of my life is a battle for the paint brush that colors my reality. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can do it. Literally I am contemplating suicide because this is so brutal. I cannot even live in reality anymore and be invested in my story because I‚Äôm looking at it from this broadened detrimental perspective

Guys‚Ä¶ any ideas on a more specific mental illness I might have and why you think I have it?? I really just want to know the right path to take for healing because I don‚Äôt even know what this is, and because of that I have no idea whether it will progressively get worse, will get better with time and I just need to wait it out, or what therapies/practices or meds I should look into.

Text:
I (23M) was in a relationship with my ex (22F) for a year. We loved each other intensely, almost foolishly. She was a genuinely amazing person‚Äîsupportive, kind, and loving. She stood by me even when I had doubts, and I struggled because she had so many great qualities. But suddenly, everything changed, and now it feels like I never existed to her.

The Biggest Issue in Our Relationship:

From the start, my struggle was acceptance‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt feel 100% sure about her. I liked her, but I kept questioning whether she was ""the one."" She knew about my hesitation and was patient, believing we could work through it.

Despite my doubts, we were deeply connected. I was incredibly supportive of her, especially during her mental health struggles. I went to therapy, both for myself and to understand her condition. I tried everything to make this relationship work, and she did the same for me.

What Happened to Her? (A Breakdown in Steps)

1. She stopped taking her medication (Carbalt) in late January 2025.


2. She entered a phase of unusual energy, confidence, and hyperactivity‚Äîa stark contrast to her usual withdrawn self.


3. Then, she faced multiple personal crises:

Fights with her family.

Conflict with an old friend (who was also the sister of her ex).



4. She started showing drastic personality changes:

Became aggressive, impulsive, and confrontational.

Started swearing more and posting bizarre videos with confusing statements.

Changed her online identity and dressed differently.



5. A few days later, she broke up with me, saying:

""We were lying to ourselves. Your eyes were never fully on me.""

""This relationship wasn‚Äôt right for us.""



6. I simply asked her not to talk about me on TikTok. She reacted by:

Sending me a 5-minute voice note full of insults.

Blocking me everywhere.




How I Tried to Help

Even after she blocked me, I knew something was wrong. I contacted her therapist, who then reached out to her family. They couldn‚Äôt find her for hours.

I went to another doctor near her home for advice.

I helped track her phone location to get her safely to the hospital.

She was hospitalized for weeks.


Meanwhile, she started messaging one of my old friends, someone I had past conflicts with because she used to be overly friendly with him. She told him everything about our relationship, even though she once said:

""If I ever leave you, I‚Äôll disappear from your life completely, including your friends.""
Now, they still talk to this day.


After She Got Out of the Hospital

She reopened social media but removed me instead of blocking me this time.

When I saw her stories, she removed me completely.

She acts as if I never existed.


What Her Cousin Told Me (Who Still Talks to Her)

I reached out to her cousin, Randa, who told me:

She still holds resentment toward anyone who was around her during her crisis.

She believes everyone who tried to help actually hurt her.

She isn‚Äôt ready to face people who remind her of that period.


Edit : I didn't ask for the diagnosis as the therapist told me that his ethics can't allow him doing that, I didn't ask her cousin and i really need to know what happened but it seems in our culture that may be i will be an Intruder as We didn't get married or even plan seriously to do so we were just in a romantic relationship and literally fixing my sight and acceptance for here at therapy sessions cause we both wanted to continue but I didn't dully accept her, she knew all of that ,even though she loved and accepted the state as it was till we figure it out.


üåÄFor what really happened after all of that month at the hospital, I couldn't ask her family about her due to our society restrictions , I was praying for ger for a month and giving her such excuses as she wasn't normal at doing these actions , then I was surprised after a month that she was talking to that friend that we struggled due to him , then appearing on social media and removing me from Instagram and Facebook and interacting with these friend and here other friends like Don't care about my reaction...
Even though that friend came and told me everything and said to me that he respected my My existence back in her life so not treating her like she will not be his gf 
But she is acting like she didn't know me before and I am afraid to talk to her or even seeing her in the university as the therapist said she might take  a bad action against you or I might even see her with another one or in a bad state that hurts me 

I EVEN DIDN'T MOVE ON TILL A MONTH LATER without knowing anything about here and just waiting her to heal (which still in progress) and just GIVING HER AN EXCUSE THAT SHE IS ILL , now SHE IS LIVING HER LIFE LOOKING GOOD AND TALKING TO THAT FRIEND AND I'M STUCK HERE DIDN'T EVEN TAKE THE ACTION OF MOVING ON ! 
 
I really so loyal to her but her actions rn are so painful to me despite their reason wether they're due to mental illness or Personal will& personal decision 

The therapist told me that she blocked me when that happened earlier and when she left the hospital she removed me again ü§∑üèª
I think removing is different than blocking for her as she was believing that doors might be opened in the future again and she actually told me that when she blocked me but I'm afraid that these doors might not open again anymore üò≠ as chatgpt said that these traumatic people might change with No way back
---

Now, I‚Äôm here, wondering what actually happened.
Did her mental health shift make her genuinely stop loving me? Was this truly a breakup she wanted, or was it influenced by her condition?

Has anyone else experienced something like this? Can someone just delete you from their life so easily after everything?

1i8duk3,I need a quick help for the insanity I'm experiencing,mentalillness,1737665923.0,15,5,"I am going through an overwhelmingly serious mental inexplicable subconscious problem that is driving me crazy in absolute silence so please hear me out!

I'm a third-grade college student, and there's this girl in my class who joined us just this year because she was supposed to make it to 4th grade but she failed and had to restudy the materials she failed at. Anyways

As far as I can remember, ever since I caught sight of her, and I hope I'm not exaggerating but I can say that, she has been living inside my head !!! Like for every single day that I, only, see her for a few moments, my mind keeps replaying those images of her like a movie and this is making me think about her all the damn time! As if she has completely taken over my mind and I've got nothing else to think about. Like the sight of her creates visual images and vocals, when I hear her voice, and they're kept as echoes inside my mind and they stick there and never leave! It's not just some overthinking because this caused lots of impacts on the mental and physical level. Like in addition to that, the amount of fake scenarios about her where I imagined us together are countless which makes me emotional or upset.

I also hear the voices of me talking to other people I know about it or even talking to myself questioning what the h'ck is going on with me. As if my mind is begging for help and wants me to say something. These voices drive me nuts and sometimes they are louder than reality which makes me can't focus on something or on study or during lectures. In addition to that, I'm feeling a weird discomfort and anxiety in my body and esp in my chest like my heart is aching, this happens daily or semi daily at least and for several hours a day and in sudden moments or when I'm extensively thinking. Also for every day that I'd go back home i spend an hour just sitting and doing nothing and start overthinking without any control over it with a disturbed and upset look on me like there's something wrong. That's when I have no will to do anything, and it makes me lose all passion and feel unwilling to do anything. I'm imprisoned by these thoughts, and probably will keep being like that for several hours or the next day.

The amount of negative thoughts made me feel sick. I've become obsessed with this problem and there's a war going in my mind because of this. I'm sure I don't have any other problems in my life that might be the reason because this absolutely never happened to me before and I've been noticing these same symptoms for almost 3 months now.
Like I don't know what to do, this developed a great amount of insecurities and self doubt and thinking that I'm crazy and there's something wrong with me. It's all making everything worse and it's all in a subconscious way and it's so hard for me to express it or admit it even to myself. Like I'm in denial of it. Also, absolutely no human being knows about this because I feel like it's gonna turn into a real problem if I told somebody because I hoped it'd stop suddenly someday but it didn't.

It seems something so addictive like I always try to distract myself from thinking but it would just go back later. The only times I feel sometimes Ok and/or distracted is when listening to music, sleeping or sometimes engaging with someone in a conversation or being in some event I'm interacting with. As if my mind needs a strong distraction to forget her, music did a good job at that because it mostly changed my mood for the better when I felt low. But this is all just temporary like my mind can't let it go, it's not in my hand. I may even think I saw her in my dreams a few times now. A problem that is more annoying is, the images of her in my mind are so blurry as if she's a ghost because I used to always forget her face but still I know I'm thinking about her and feeling something.

It's so crazy like this can't be some kind of random thing from my brain that decided to suddenly like her and think about her because I don't even know her at all! All the being said, I don't not, or try not to, pay attention to her when she's there!

The only thing that I seem to obviously know, is that well, she's ""relatively pretty"", or at least prettier, in a unique way(maybe I'm the only one who sees her like that IDK), she's noticeably shorter than me, also a bit older than me, which yeah it may have mode me feel strongly attracted to her (but I was ignoring that and didn't wanna do anything about it), like her presence makes a difference. it's something I felt for the first time and it didn't happen before. But still this is not an enough reason for all of this to happen and it sounds so negative and insane and it doesn't make sense at all. This can't be just happening because I only see her for 20 seconds a week. The thought of this makes me feel much angry sometimes. It is something that I so much struggle to understand and find an answer to. I know all of this sounds crazy but I guess it's mostly true. At least there's something.

So finally, what do you think? What should I do about it? I need a solution that would stop me from thinking and just make me see her as any other girl, I hope this solution. doesn't include interacting with her in any way.",no reason to live

Been to therapy since I was 6 years old, when I began in adult therapy in 2018 my first therapist told me I fulfill the list of being antisocial but she didn‚Äôt want to put a serious diagnosis this young. 
2018 I was diagnosed borderline. 
2019 - bipolar. 
None of my these ever felt ‚Äúright‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt really spend time questioning it. 

My childhood is completely fucked. 
All my exes have told me I‚Äôm cold and worried that when we break up I would continue my life as if nothing ever happened. 
I don‚Äôt feel sad when I don‚Äôt see people I should care for, we have had a lot of deaths in close circles which I try to distance myself from because I find it very exhausting. 
I don‚Äôt really feel much empathy for people around me at all, no connection other than communication - I tend to protect the ones who are good people, more. 

Im known in friend groups as a little aggressive, the one you can come to at a bar if ur being bothered by some dude or something. I‚Äôve been in fights though I‚Äôve lost every time, come home with broken ribs. 
I‚Äôve been abusing drugs since I was 16, not heavily though. 

I think my clearest indication for me is how (and I might be wrong but) I really wanted an explanation for why I am the way I am so I went hard in on tricking my therapists - a lot of my documentations are wrong because I‚Äôve been manipulating the truth to the point it isn‚Äôt easy to get to the bottom of where the lies started, mostly for the reason of having access to calming medication. 

I remember being mean to animals when I was younger, as an experiment I dissected a frog - really random but maybe valuable info? Idk. 
I wouldn‚Äôt hurt any animals today, never. I wasn‚Äôt older than 8 when this happened. 

I feel alien most of the time. I don‚Äôt really feel superior, just nonchalant at all times, bugs me when people go soft or romantic, it‚Äôs not necessary. 

I don‚Äôt often feel connected to other people, i forget them if they‚Äôre not there, when someone I love dies - which happened recently, multiple times, I sense death anxiety but my life continues and I don‚Äôt think of them very often. 
I would prefer if they still lived tho. 

All of this is things I don‚Äôt talk about to anyone. 
My mother works as a therapist and drug worker, she has distanced from me ever since I was a teenager - I let hell loose in those years and we never had the same relationship after but she never wants to talk to me about why, I never had an explanation to tell me. 

It‚Äôs the last few days I‚Äôve been really thinking about if the first adult therapist i had was right about my lack of empathy, if so I‚Äôm happy she didn‚Äôt actually put a diagnosis as it would be affecting my treatment in therapy negatively. 
I am not going to talk about this to anyone and especially not anyone with access to prescriptions or valuable medical records. 

Would appreciate any feedback, I‚Äôm curious. 
Thank you.

Answer to comment: 

I am not going to pursue my thoughts about it, covering behind bipolar is way more beneficial and I know about stigmas for any type of empathy lacking- airing the theme anonymously only. Back when I was 16 my life was based with drugs, police and child protective services I was moved by myself for my mom‚Äôs sake, trashed everything around me. To me everything involving adrenaline fun, not the typical ‚ÄúI‚Äôm depressed so I‚Äôm doing drugs and making trouble‚Äù, it was only fun to me.

Later in the 2nd semester of my junior year, I broke up with him and soon after dropped out for having no support system and being depressed by it. It‚Äôs been roughly a year since then and I‚Äôve discovered/researched about BPD. I strongly relate to the symptoms of BPD, like being overly emotional and having black and white thinking. But some things I don‚Äôt relate to or I do but I don‚Äôt do these things often. Things like rage. I‚Äôve seen that most people who have BPD will get triggered by something and split into rage. I‚Äôve done this, but not so much that it would be considered rage splitting. I have however seen there are different types of splitting? Like isolation splitting and even one that‚Äôs called euphoria. I‚Äôve experienced both but I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm lying to myself for no reason..I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm secretly someone who wants to be perceived as mentally ill so people will feel bad for me. But I genuinely feel how I feel so why would I lie? Loneliness feels so horrible. I feel like I‚Äôm constantly walking in slow motion under water with weighted blankets drooped over my entire being. But I‚Äôm comfortable. The sadness I feel is comforting and safe. But I‚Äôm alone with no one around me. And when I‚Äôm alone and don‚Äôt get invited to be around my family in the living room I get so hurt and mad. Like ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt they invite me? I‚Äôm here and I wanna spend time together? I don‚Äôt wanna be alone. I want to have fun too. Do they even care if I‚Äôm there? I‚Äôm all alone and they have no concern about it‚Äù and then I start to think about how no one cares bc I always do this and it‚Äôs just normal‚Ä¶or that they didn‚Äôt invite me bc they all hate me and are glad I‚Äôm not out. Then I get mad. Why wouldn‚Äôt the care? In their family and they don‚Äôt want to be around me? But what if they‚Äôre just giving me my space? They know I get sad.. they know I struggle with certain things. Maybe they just wanted to give me some time alone. But I didn‚Äôt want to be alone? Idk. I‚Äôm not self diagnosing obviously..and I have spoken with my mom about this. And my older sister. My sister studies psychology and told my mom she thinks I have BPD. It‚Äôs not a diagnosis but it‚Äôs definitely something I should look into right? Idk help please. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy and I‚Äôm not even an adult yet. ",no reason to live
1j0gmhy,I am so confused with what‚Äôs wrong with me,mentalillness,1740772420.0,6,3,"I am a 17 year old girl and i believe more and more everyday that i might have some sort of mental condition, I feel like im so different from everyone else and im struggling to fit in. 

When it comes to talking to people, I am really good at keeping the conversation going, in the sense of I can keep them talking for a while but when it comes to my turn to talk I do not know what to say, as in my head is completely empty there are no thoughts what I have to share. The only times where I am able to contribute to the conversation is when I am talking about current things such as the food we are currently eating or something alike but I just can‚Äôt think of anything else to talk to the other person about. I feel as though I may not have explained that properly but it‚Äôs hard to get into words the things that are going on in your head. Also to clarify I do not have social anxiety, I have given speeches to an over a hundred people crowd and have been completely fine and I do not have issues approaching people as well. I have just noticed my lack of input in conversations.

Carrying on, i‚Äôm not too sure what order to go into so i‚Äôll move on to my childhood. I have never shared this before so i‚Äôm a little apprehensive but when I was younger I was very interested in certain things, I would often bite other young children and only release them when they began to cry, so as to not get caught in the act, for no other reason other than I simple wanted to. Additionally I did some other things which i do not yet feel comfortable enough to share.

I understand self diagnosis is frowned upon however I am quite sure I had OCD as a child. To briefly explain, every time I walked past a bathroom I had to wash my hands and face 11 times, I also had to repeat the same long prayer every night 5 times without interruption so that I could fall asleep and if anyone did interrupt me I had to restart right from the beginning and repeat 5 times again. I also had a massive issue with sharing my food and drinks with anyone that wasn‚Äôt my mother otherwise I literally wouldn‚Äôt be able to finish my meal. Another thing I remember is my freakish control over my bed, if anyone touched it in the slightest and my covers looked slightly messy I would get so frustrated and warm in a way I can‚Äôt even explain. 

This may be a normal occurrence however when I was younger I would mess with other children‚Äôs belongings, moving one item from a child‚Äôs bag into another so they would think someone stole it and accuse them. I used to also steal things from the other children however this might be something every child did? 

In my daily life now multiple people have told me that they think that I have autism but I disagree as I can do very well in social situations in the way of presenting myself. I do not have any issues with eye contact, or have any fidgeting behaviours, I find it very easy to make friends and when I do talk I feel as though it is quite normally just like how everyone else talks, and I would also say i‚Äôm quite good at reading people‚Äôs body language. 

I don‚Äôt even enjoy talking to my family members, and I haven‚Äôt for the longest time that I can remember, mainly due to how much energy I have to use to change how I act so I can be ‚Äònormal‚Äô enough for them to not say anything to me, not to mention how much of my time that it wastes by them telling me things I already know. 

I feel like my head is so empty a lot of the time where I literally don‚Äôt care enough to think about anything. I also feel as though I have a usually strong attraction to doing things such as drugs to be able to feel something larger for once, although I haven‚Äôt actually. 

When it comes to emotions I feel as though I don‚Äôt feel them correctly, based on how everyone around me acts. I don‚Äôt have any reactions to anything, I find myself faking it constantly so the people around me don‚Äôt notice anything and it‚Äôs honestly so tiring. For example on birthdays I genuinely feel nothing the entire day and it is the same as every other for me, even though my family has huge celebrations and then entire day is about me so don‚Äôt feel anything at all, when i‚Äôm hanging out with my friends too I feel so neutral majority of the time. Honestly I feel as though I live out majority of my days feeling very neutral, i‚Äôm always just fine.

Occasionally i‚Äôll feel sad maybe once every three months, but I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever felt angry before. I‚Äôm trying to recollect now but I also don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever truly felt happy as well just satisfied. 

It doesn‚Äôt bother me to be like this but I can see how everyone else acts around me and it‚Äôs gotten me curious as to why i‚Äôm so different? ",no reason to live
1jr4nc0,My trauma and mental illness have enabled me to become an abuser,mentalillness,1743745355.0,1,3,"***Trigger warning: emotional abuse, mention of childhood neglect, homophobia, and transphobia, religion mentioned***

I don't think I'm an awful person, but I am an explosive and emotionally weak person, as well as weak-willed. I had been abused by my mom and dad for well over a decade, because of my mental illnesses and the fact I tried coming out as gay and trans several times. I moved out to try to save my life when I turned 18, and not only did I end up moving into yet another emotionally abusive home, I brought my trauma with me. I had not healed yet, I hadn't even started healing. I still am not properly healing, over 6 years later.

I yell and scream at my boyfriend when we get into arguments. I throw stuff at the wall and begin to punch myself. I call him names, like asshole, motherfucker, bitch. I've said fuck you so many times. I've never laid hands on him, or thought of hurting him, but I understand emotional/verbal abuse is just as bad as physical. He is an alcoholic and I resented him for a long time, but sometimes when I think long and hard about it, I think I'm the reason he's never gotten sober. He drinks bc I've ruined a chunk of his life.

He doesn't yell at me, doesn't call me names. Only raises his voice when I've already started yelling and berating him. He sometimes punches himself when he has a breakdown, I think he may be autistic, being genuine. He's never hurt me physically or thrown things.

I'm slowly getting better, I think. Very slowly. We were both unemployed for 8 months, and now we have jobs again and I'm less angry. But now the guilt eats me alive, I love him so much. I have stained our relationship with my behavior. We've wanted to get married for years, just haven't been able to afford it. It's also gotten to a point where I silently think if he should marry me at all. I don't want to dull his shine, make him feel bad about himself. But I have, I have done that.

My parents used to always scream at me as a child. My dad has ocd, bipolar 2, and ""aspergers"" as he continues to call it.

I get so angry, so so angry. As soon as he tries to tell me I'm acting like a jerk or refusing to communicate, I feel my blood begin to boil, my anger and sadness and frustration, it all begins to spill over, the stove being flooded and water sizzling and popping all over. I feel so sad, and hurt, and hopeless, like I've ruined every good thing in my life, I feel so guilty and ashamed.

I can't afford therapy or psychiatry right now, I've been at my new job less than 3 weeks. I can't even afford new glasses or all of my current medications.

I feel so hopeless. Everything I strove to change, to heal, to be better than... I have not risen above the abuse and pain I went through. I have no place to put it down, so I myself have become an abuser. Sometimes I think he should leave me, or I should leave so he can find someone healthy and be happy.

I'm trying very hard to change. I am chronically exhausted, my eyes ache, I am haunted by nightmares. I have tried to genuinely reach out and apologize to people I've hurt. They ignore my messages and my phone calls, but I just say that you don't have to accept my apology, but I am sorry. I am so so sorry.

I haven't asked him, ""how is our relationship to you? How can I improve?"" In over a year. I am too afraid. Nothing I can say will make what I've done better. We don't even have sex, although I understand, he has a physical disability on top of his bipolar disorder. But I also understand, if someone treats you like trash, why would you want to be vulnerable and sleep with them?

How do I fix it all. How do I make it right. It hurts so bad. I am afraid of myself. Every time I rapid cycle, or go deep deep into an episode, I borderline act insane. I will never hurt him, never, but what do those words matter when I have hurt his feelings, over and over and over.

I haven't believed in God since I was 9 years old. He has never ever responded to me when I prayed. But I'm at a point where I need somebody; God, the universe, the devil, my ancestors, my predecessors, aliens: give me a sign. Give me a sign that I am capable of being a good person, a soft person, and loving and kind and caring person. Please God, let me be better. I don't want to spend the rest of my short life with hatred, pain, and selfloathing living inside my heart.",no reason to live

I never cheated,  never went for taken people, never spilled secrets etc. it's not that kind of ""I feel like a bad person"", I neglect people 1 moment and the next I'm all over them.

1jilq10,It feels like we are falling apart..,mentalillness,1742803910.0,4,3,"I am 17 years old ‚Äî a boy trapped in a cycle of self-destruction.
I procrastinate, I watch porn, I vape, I carve my pain into my skin.
For five years, I have been nothing but a ghost.
Now, I have no friends.
Not one.
My family, lost in their own vices, drowns out my presence.
Often, I just want to disappear forever.

She is 18.
A girl with a heart too big for this world.
She calls herself a people pleaser.
Unfortunately she gives until there‚Äôs nothing left of her.
Life never made things easy.
People used her, betrayed her, left scars too deep to fade.
She‚Äôs lost good friends, suffered panic attacks that steal the air from her lungs.
She believes she doesn‚Äôt deserve food, doesn‚Äôt deserve care.
She cuts herself.
She has tried to die ‚Äî more than once.

And yet, somehow, we found each other.

It started three months ago.

That night, I tried to end my life.
But morning came, and I was still here.
So I wrote.
Poured my pain into a Reddit post, hoping someone, anyone, would hear me.
No one did.

Until her.

She sent a message.
Told me she was sorry.
That I deserved more.
Gave me words I never knew I needed.
I thanked her, thinking that was the end of it.

But the next day, she asked if I had eaten.
If I had drunk enough water.
(At the time, I barely ate at all.)
I answered.
Then I answered again.
And again.
And again.

Soon, we spoke every day.
Hours passing like seconds.
We unraveled everything‚Äîour pasts, our fears, our dreams, the pieces of ourselves we never dared to show the world.
There was no judgment.
No shame.
Only understanding.

Weeks passed before we understood.

One evening, I bought flowers, took a picture, and told her she meant the world to me.
She was quiet at first.
Then, she told me she loved me.
A moment later, I said it back.
It felt so right.

We grew closer.
Every whispered ‚ÄûI love you,‚Äù every ‚ÄûI wish I could hold you‚Äù, every ‚ÄûI want to fall asleep beside you and wake up to your warmth‚Äù pulled us deeper into something neither of us had ever known.
For both of us it's the first relationship.

And then came desire.

The thought of her ignited something inside me.
A longing.
To touch.
Neither of us has ever known intimacy, but if we were together, we would.
Slowly. Gently. Desperately.
Not just for the act itself, but for the connection, the feeling of being real in each other‚Äôs arms.
She wants that.
I want that.
We developed passionate fantasies together.
She tells me she would give herself to me completely.
She says it over and over.

But the world is cruel.
We are over six thousand kilometers apart.
Don't speak the same language.
Our English is bad.
It leaves no room for calls, for video, for more than just words on a screen.
We are trapped in distance, in silence.
And it is unbearable.
I'm also scared of direct contact.
It's so complicated.

She loves me with every piece of herself.
I know that.
But I cannot let her cling to a shadow she will never touch.
And yet, she won‚Äôt let go.
‚ÄûAnything for you.‚Äù

I am still that same lost boy, drowning in my own darkness.
I am immature.
I am not a good person.
Not even close.
And yet, I make her happy.
I don‚Äôt understand why, but I do.

I can‚Äôt even maintain a normal friendship.
How could I ever hold onto love?
All the dreams we share ‚Äî I know they will never become reality.
And it crushes me.
It makes me want to scream.

I don‚Äôt want to lose her.
She is my first love.
My only love.
The deepest connection I have ever known.
But I feel us slipping.

If I walk away, I fear she won‚Äôt survive it.
And I cannot bear that weight.

But if we stay, this pain will only grow.
I know that, too.

What am I supposed to do?
What the hell am I supposed to do?

I don‚Äôt want to let her go.
Because if I do, I will never find someone like her again.
Never.",life is unbearable
1j21dox,Living with a mentally ill person,mentalillness,1740949405.0,5,3,"Kind of a cry for help? My brother is diagnosed bipolar and does not take his medications properly. He has not been able to keep up with school, a job, or anything meaningful in life. My family has tried to take extreme measures to get him to go to CAMH or a mental institution but he refuses because in his head he thinks he is ok. We also have taken him to the hospital but since he does not pose an immediate threat to us or the public, they cannot do anything with him unless he admits himself, which he will not do. We even kicked him out for a few days and even being homeless he would not admit himself. He is showing signs of worse mental illness now, like talking to himself, always plugging everything out of the wall (schizophrenia??), and he cannot comprehend anything that we tell him to do. He has very messy habits and no matter how many times you tell him to do something (for example clean up after himself), he will always have a hard time taking initiative. We also have called the police to our home multiple times so they can help when he is having a bad day but again, since he does not pose an immediate threat, they do not do anything about it. My living conditions are unbearable, given this has been going on for many years, and progressively getting worse. My parents do not have the heart to put him out onto the street, but seriously he is starting to leave us without option because this is severely affecting our mental health to live with him. We have to hide multiple items out of his sight in our house as well as he seems to not have any impulse control, such as coffee pods. He would drink 15 coffees in a day if he could, without exaggeration. There is simply never a single moment of peace in this house. He is reaching 30 and at this point his future looks like a long term care home for mentally ill people? But even this we can't afford. Did not mention I have a single mom and she has to take care of this all on her own. Any word of advice at all? I cannot continue to live like this action needs to be taken.

My problems with my pain have been effecting me everyday of my life and with every task that I like to do in my life and just feel if this is how I‚Äôm gonna be living the rest of my life then I would rather not be here.

It all started around 2 years ago when I started getting mild random pains in different body parts but thought nothing of it as was not alarming to me anyways fast forward a year from that and the pain increased by a major amount and along with this the pain was a daily thing in my life still I had hope at this point in time and had faith the doctors would be able to fix the issue. 

Fast forward to today and my life is just becoming he‚Äôll I‚Äôm in extreme pain for most of the day wether I‚Äôm doing activity‚Äôs or not it‚Äôs affecting my college and work and even was going to quit both of them because it was just unbearable to work as can‚Äôt stand up for more than 30mins without my knees completely giving out. I‚Äôve had 10+ appointments with doctors and it just seems I‚Äôm getting nowhere they haven‚Äôt done anything to point me in the right direction to being cured and I have just accepted that they will not be able to cure this as chronic pain is very hard to diagnose. 

I‚Äôm just really hopeless my life has gone to shit and can‚Äôt see myself doing anything with it it‚Äôs destroying my friendships, my relationships with parents . Everyday has been the same for the last year I‚Äôll go to work get through the day in extreme pain which makes work 10x worse then go home and my legs feel like I‚Äôve just ran a marathon. 

I am really passionate about the gym and have been for the past year and a half and it‚Äôs the only thing that I really love doing and has helped with my confidence so much but with these pains i just feel like my dream and the only thing that I am good at doing, the only thing that I find joy in life and its getting taken away from me due to my body I can not go to the gym without high level of burning pain which is making me start to not enjoy it . I remeber before I had these issues and when I‚Äôd train of course it would hurt my muscles but since I‚Äôve had this the pain of training has increased by 10x no exaggeration . 

I‚Äôm just getting to a point where I feel I‚Äôm going to end up ending it there‚Äôs just no hope left I just can not live like this for much longer I have no life anymore and have been mentally destroyed and all of these problems and I‚Äôm only 18 years old!

1j49f6a,"Depression, loneliness, freaking out, being followed",mentalillness,1741197829.0,0,1,"Hi every1,

I would like to speak with simple terms. 

I am alone. It‚Äôs different feeling at different times. Sometimes it feels weird, like crazy weird. I have relatives, but only remotely. Nobody to meet in range of few hundred kilometers. I am in quite big city, but no one seems truly relative. Everyone is stranger for me. Some people maybe are a little bit more than that, but still I have be cautious like minesweeper, and can‚Äôt relate too deeply bc I can be hurt any moment. I live almost in constant stress, and sometimes it freaks me out. I get depressed.

I try to take good care of myself, eat fresh, get enough move, sleep well. But loneliness sometimes catches me at my core and chokes me, doing damage. Time passes, i get calm, but I think that it just waits to get again at me in my weak point. 

It‚Äôs fucking insane that I can go quite well for some time and then I get caught with bad mood, almost out of nowhere. Makes me want to suspend my living. 

I see no point in being alive. I am conscious that not everyday is roses and sweets, but for fuck sake, when i am feeling down, it gets too heavy, and I think it happens too often. 

I don‚Äôt want any strangers help, I don‚Äôt want anybody invading my life. And when I even think about inviting anyone to any social activity, just the idea seems unbearable. I feel plain uncomfortable saying any inventing terms, I feel almost retarded, certainly cringe. Like I do not fit anywhere, and likeability of me is at 0%.

I don‚Äôt drink and I don‚Äôt smoke because I value good health, but that gets me nowhere anyway. At some point I can take drink and smoke, just to feel relief, and feel bad for a while afterwards. It‚Äôs sick. 

I really try to spend wise, don‚Äôt waste food, and spend time active, thinking about getting  degree. Still I see no future, I‚Äôm getting mad. 

I don‚Äôt have dog or cat, I only rent a little room, I don‚Äôt want a mice or fish bc they are not too interactive, as I believe another human is. 

I‚Äôm freaking out rn, just been to outdoor gym, but felt overwhelmed, just as I started to warm up. I did not took my headphones with me, and there came many people for exercise as well or I don‚Äôt know for what. It was quite calm apart from few kids, but then they came like twenty or thirty people. I could not bear exercising with them on my little quiet exercise‚Ä¶ just too much, made me freak out.

And last thing. I do not believe strangers in anything bc believing is very straight way to being deceived. Even if people talk about me saying I am nice or look good or so, I don‚Äôt believe, because one second later then can say something totally different. 

I don‚Äôt believe any1 would care to spend their time and attention to read this shit (apart from people who follows my most moves but don‚Äôt talk shit with me), but if you spend any, I think you wasted it, bc nothing helps me, apart from something that don‚Äôt really exists right now. I hope you will find better things to do that will benefit you.

1i0rz0e,"My health struggles, what do they mean?",mentalillness,1736810962.0,6,1,"I know this is long and rambling at points, but I need to put this out there. And I need advice. 


My knee/leg hurts badly every day. Some days i can barely walk. I cant stand for any extended period of time. My back hurts every day, but not as bad as my knee. I get different pains everywhere randomly also, but they feel different than my leg/back pain. The pain in my knee started 3 months ago, and I've had NO RELIEF from all the doctors visits.

i feel sick frequently. Almost flu-like, and feel like i have fevers with my whole body aching.i feel bedridden, and too exhausted sometimes to even make myself a meal or shower. I sometimes do normal every day tasks, like walking around in the grocery store, or simply just walking around the house for a minute or 2. It feels like I just ran a marathon! 

I'm constantly anxious. I'm afraid to go anywhere, do anything. I fear being shamed or judged. I feel awkward in every social interaction. I don't know how to communicate effectively, and fail miserably in any kind of social gathering. Writing is my preferred way of communication, as it gives me the time I need. With verbal communication, I get panicky. i dont know what to say in the moment.  I fumble my words, mumble, and sometimes people can't even understand the words I'm saying. I have to repeat it. And then the anxious feelings erupt because now I feel like I'm strange. And i go straight to what i always do, wanting to run away/disappear. And I constantly am in a thought spiral and can't concentrate on anything except what just happened and how I'm perceived. It  creates pure panic.

I can't enjoy anything. I'm constantly worrying about something that happened in the past, whether it was 10 seconds ago or yesterday or years ago. And if I'm not worried about the past, I'm worried about the future. It makes enjoyment nearly impossible. I can't concentrate on movies, stories, etc. Thinking too much, all the time. And it never stops. I have found gaming helps to an extent. But even then, I don't find myself experiencing joy, it's just distracting from the constant pain, and that's what it serves as. A distraction from mental, physical, and emotional pain.

It feels like being constantly pushed into hell then out of it again. The feelings are abnormally intense. The misery and pain are unbearable that every single time I experience them I consider taking my life just to end the pain.

Imagine being set on fire and being unable to do anything about it but get consumed by the pain until you burn. Now imagine this happening over and over in your life. When that happens I can only gasp, cry, and often times lock myself up wanting to scream my lungs out. I want to shout for help, I want release. It hurts so terribly bad that i am willing to try anything to stop it.

Help me. It‚Äôs like the walls are caving in. No medicine is strong enough. I‚Äôm crawling in my skin. Sometimes I feel like giving up. But I just can't. It isn't in my blood

And that‚Äôs where the impulsivity comes from. We want anything that will make us feel better, anything to put the fire out.  and in my case, it‚Äôs almost always quitting. Quitting my job, my activities, cutting off ties with friends or my lover. I just want to disappear. It‚Äôs illogical and  I know it's illogical.

But how do you tell a person on fire to use logic?

The worst thing is anything trivial can trigger this. And because of this I always feel bad, because I shouldn‚Äôt be feeling this. It‚Äôs such a trivial matter so why am I acting so dramatic like the world is ending?

But there‚Äôs no control. I call it shit storms. I see it approaching and it‚Äôs huge. Probably caused by nothing. About to destroy me and everyone around me. But how do you stop storms? I see it coming, and theres nothing i can do to stop it.

It‚Äôs draining.

I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm always tired. Even with a lot of sleep, I still feel tired. 

I frequently have dreams. Sometimes good, but mostly bad. And frequently they consist of me being tortured, or dying. Or not being able to save someone. Or sometimes I have dreams involving the death of my child, like she's talking to me and telling me she's sad that I am sad, or that she's disappointed in me. 

I‚Äôm sick of battling my brain all the time. I can‚Äôt face the world and its struggles when I‚Äôm constantly weakened.

I always wonder how people live till they are 80. I don‚Äôt want to live that long. In fact, some days I wake up hoping it‚Äôs my last day. I‚Äôm in my 30s yet it feels like a lived for a century already.

I've considered suicide. it‚Äôs not because I am miserable in the moment, It‚Äôs because there is no end to it. How can such a wreck keep going, all while facing a storm after the other? I don‚Äôt see a way out. Therapy and meds will water down the symptoms but never kill them. And I‚Äôm too injured at this point that I can‚Äôt even take a small cut anymore.

yet, the crazy thing is when I‚Äôm happy it‚Äôs also so intense that everyone, including myself, has a hard time believing I‚Äôm sick. I‚Äôm jumpy and giggly. I love life and people. I want to spread my joy, make people laugh, say funny things. It feels like I‚Äôm flying! But I‚Äôve gone around in circles for too long to be fooled by my temporary ecstasy.

After being thrown into hell and out of it for so long my brain goes numb to adapt. When that happens, I feel like I don‚Äôt exist. Like everything happening around me is a TV show that I‚Äôm watching through a screen. Like the voices and sounds around me are happening with a barrier. I‚Äôm alive even if I‚Äôm not feeling anything.


But at this point, I'm just drifting through life. I‚Äôll keep taking my meds and going to doctors while waiting for the end. I want to live. I want to enjoy life. I want to be healthy. It shows that I'm fighting. If I hated life I would‚Äôve ended it long ago.  Yet deep inside me, a very small part wants to live. And for that part I‚Äôll keep going. Because giving up isn‚Äôt in my blood

When I feel guilt about anything, it's overwhelming.  Even if I apologize or try to come to terms with a bad action, it haunts me for longer than I feel is normal. It makes me want to vanish. And I can't blame anything or anyone else with a clear conscious. Deep inside, I know it's me that's the problem, but it feels like there's nothing i can do to prevent or resolve it. 

Im very isolated. I don‚Äôt make friends. If I go out and some people start befriending me, I usually find a way to avoid them eventually. Or i do or say something that i shouldn't, furthering embarrassment and shame.

People bring me stress. Being alone all the time makes me feel bored and empty. I am stuck between the two.

I find it difficult to work, because of the people. That has always been the biggest struggle. It's mentally exhausting constantly worrying about how I'm perceived or if I have said something wrong or interacted with someone in an awkward way.
 I feel physical pain, every day, whether its a headache, shoulders, back, legs, feet, or sometimes even my chest or arms. It is especially bad in my left knee/leg, it NEVER goes away. The back pain never goes away, but i'd say for to compare the level of pain to my knee pain, its like a 5 and the knee pain is a 9. I am constantly tired. Even with an abundance of sleep, still tired. 
Also, I feel that things are meaningless generally. I know I need money to survive but I have no desire to accumulate money and things and a house.. why? so I can live an empty, meaningless life with more expensive things? The point is, rich or poor, internally I feel the same 

Sometimes, I have angry meltdowns but the only person who will see it is my closest (only) friend and the 1 person I would trust to behave that way in front of. I feel like a cornered animal and scream and shout with rage. Most of the anger has no direction, it is just frustrated anger, triggered by intense helplessness.

It‚Äôs really bad to suffer from this, my life has been nothing but constant struggle, interspersed with some temporary successes (I wouldn‚Äôt describe it as happiness) which inevitably end up back at square one again and I am left with nothing once more. Over and over

Depression, suicidal thoughts, these are fairly routine and then it is broken up by switching into an ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù attitude/persona which alleviates those feelings, but often causes some trouble because that is when I might distance myself from others, isolate,  etc. then return to the quiet type once more and have to deal with the consequences. It takes a lot of energy to switch up. Then later I don‚Äôt care again‚Ä¶ switching back and forth.

There‚Äôs never anything solid. Nothing is ever built and maintained. Everything is short-lived. That‚Äôs the theme of it all. It‚Äôs  like groundhog day, waking up each day and having to start all over again from nothing, and never knowing what kind of bad day is coming. i feel that nothing is really there, no foundation except a past you hate and wish wasn‚Äôt there so i pretend it isn‚Äôt and try to live in the moment, but feel empty and lost.


What sucks the most is that people forget that you‚Äôre sick. You‚Äôre just weird, dramatic, gloomy, hypersensitive, and mean. That's how I picture everyone thinks about me. I feel like i spread toxic vibes everywhere I go. Routine and normal things cause stress. Noise causes discomfort. I can no longer be around my girlfriend and her son for extended periods, because I just want to disappear. They're acting perfectly normal, but somehow it causes stress. There's no real logical reason why that I can explain. Over the years I've developed a good game face. I feel like I have to. People will judge me as being too sensitive and dramatic when I tell them I'm experiencing pain in any form.

In public, I watch others. How they carry themselves, the way they socialize and interact. The way they can carry a conversation, the way they walk, their body language. I will never be that. It makes me feel very different. It makes me feel not human. Everything comes so naturally to them, yet I am unable to act this way with any consistency. It kills my self-esteem and confidence. 

I've gone to doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, physical therapists, chiropractors. Several times. I feel like 90% of the time , I don't feel any better after a visit. Most of the time worse, because it brings feelings of helplessness.

All of these things have been with me since I was a child. It only gets worse with every passing day. I've kept quiet for the most part out of fear. Fear of what could happen, or how my family and friends could see me. I battled through it all and just chalked it up as normal stuff people experience all the time. But now I realize, it's debilitating me. It has been debilitating me. I lived through my 20s and early 30s knowing I can still physically function, so I should be alright. But now, I feel physically sick to the bone every day. What do you do when you're not healthy physically, mentally, or emotionally all simultaneously?


I have established myself with a new medical provider (took me 3 months to get in as I was put on long waitlist). It's supposed to be the best medical treatment around.

I'm 28). It has, or the combination of these things, plus other probably ""conditions"", have, robbed me of *everything*.

I've failed out of Uni, lost a scholarship, and lost my accommodation. I've tried going back, to a different University in a very different location, *multiple times*, now, but I never seem to manage it. It's been **9 years** since I first started Undergrad, and I still have no qualification.

As a result, of that, and of the mental illness, and of a really traumatic, fucked-up family and upbringing, I have *nothing* left. I'm unemployed, single, stuck in a bad housing situation, rapidly running out of savings, while suffering through a number of *other* chronic health conditions which are becoming unbearable and unliveable...

But that's not what's killing me. No. It's the debts, and the expectations of me, as an ""unemployed person"".

Right now, I am **required** to undertake a full-time course in *how to apply for jobs*, in order to keep receiving unemployment benefits. Full-time. Online. Possibly the worst educational experience I have ever had.

Because it is online, you are expected to turn up even if you are sick, or whatever else may be going on in your life, *and you must keep your camera on, at all times*. You are not allowed to be late to a session, or you fail.

Simultaneously, I have to apply for **13 more jobs**, in the next 9 days, at pain of *also* losing my benefits. I didn't meet the target last month, and copped a ""warning"", so this time I will be ""punished for noncompliance""...

All of this at the same time as having to organize interstate travel for medical appointments, juggle arrangements to return to University at the start of July (I cannot take anymore time off), and manage all my other commitments...

I cannot cope. I *am not coping*. Yet I honestly cannot see any way out.

I can't afford to live without this money, and jobs have not been forthcoming. I really do not have any other option.

Fuck, is it any *wonder* that people feel they have no way to keep going?

This is no way to live life. I am spiralling, rapidly, and yet all I get is ""Well, it's your own fault"" or ""You let it come to this!""

I'm... Not sure how much longer I can keep this up.

The course is for three weeks straight, and then I have a mass of medical appointments and surgery in the weeks that follow that.

I know it's hard to understand the mindset of someone who has given up hope, but that's... That's me, now.

I have no prospects. Nothing more to offer. Nothing more to give.

I also came across someone who suffered from **medication-induced anhedonia**, and only ECT was able to reverse it.

I wonder if this treatment could work for me? I will now share my full story and try to cover most of the relevant details.

Three years ago, I was prescribed Antipsychotic (**Brexpiprazole)**, and it felt like **a bullet to my head**‚Äîit completely destroyed my life, even though I had no issues before taking it. As a result, I developed severe **depression**, total **anhedonia**, and an intense **burning sensation** in my head. Later, I experienced some relief with **Sertraline** and **Aripiprazole**, but unfortunately, they stopped working after some time.

Since then, I have tried about 20 different medications available in my country, but sadly, none of them helped. Life has become unbearable‚ÄîI can‚Äôt work or study, and my entire life is ruined and stagnant.

I'm too fucking lazy to go to the fridge and eat some food. I can not do the things i previosly liked to do without getting a feeling that I'm just wasting time and my potential on things that are not important; that I should focus on the tings tahat will help me grow as a person. One thing I can't wait to do after waking up is to go asleep once again. My confidence is non existant just as my social life. I just feel miserable and lonely. The worst part is the more pitifull I feel the more self-lothing I get. Cause I know I should just man up and get through the day as a man should but I'm just not able to. My suicidal thought are getting more and more unbearable, although I know that I will not do it cause I don't have cojones to do so. 
So that's about it.

1hmga77,Why ,mentalillness,1735185408.0,5,1,"Honestly I've been kinda miserable since last Friday, since my vibryd was kicking in that day during a class final.I was also taking Adderall,and Intuniv with it so that could explain some things, but basically I became super anxious as I sat down to take my final, cause I was thinking to much about some of the sad fleshbags in that class would laugh about me, and view me as one retarded human being in that class, cause I could never be sad in that class,cause once you snap once, the pathetic scumbags learn how to push your buttons, and they start pushing them, over, and over just so they can feel some joy in knowing that they have power over another human, and so I had no choice but to act like a blissfully ignorant dumbass, so they wouldn't analyze me for any hints of suffering.

I honestly acted like I never moderated anything said, so people would look at me like I'm stupid,but in reality I was moderating the things I said so desperately.If people cared enough to analyse my seemingly incoherent blubbering, they would see that I don't really have any substance to my noises.I was so sure to only say thing that had no vulnerable emotions attached, only joy,anger, and apathy, were allowed out.I would always bitch about the things I was doing or working on at the time, with the occasional shockingly vulgar,or inappropriate comment, but I wouldn't dare to talk about how miserable I was, how everyone just leaves me eventually, how I felt like people would degrade me for fun, and how everyone just looks down on me, pities me, or judges me to feel better about themselves.

If anyone ever said their just acting stupid in real life, I wouldn't believe them, and you probably won't either, cause that's a terrible idea,and if anything it would probably confirm any suspicions I had.If I'm acting I wouldn't want anyone to know, that's kinda the whole point of acting, to decive people.If I told people I actually knew in real life that I'm not actually dumb, and happy, that would be the most brain-dead thing I could ever do, cause first of all they only have seen the dumbass me, and there is no evidence to suggest a more complex me, also the whole point of acting dumb is so people don't look into me, cause I if appear dense enough, people will just assume that what they see reflects what is going on inside my ugly-ass head.if I were to reveal I am a fucking liar they'll start creating all these pretty lil questions, and effectively start a investigation on me, therefore defeating the whole point of acting dumb.Also Im only yaping on about me being a musty fake cause I'm so tired of no one being able to know this in my real life,but this is the Internet, I'll never see you so don't have to worry about the social repercussions.

The only bad thing about this is no one takes me seriously, I could say something about a question and people will just dismiss it cause I'm the stupid kid, and then 2 minutes later the answer key is shown, and I turn out to be right.This is unbearable in my family life cause they know I'm mentally fucked, but I never tell them anything, and so they think they know me so well cause they've known me for too long,but they don't know shit. If disagree with anything, or say something they don't like, they just act like like nothing I say makes sense,or I'm just irrational cause I'm fucked in the head in their eyes so my opinion or input is irrelevant, cause I'm just SoOOoO hysterical.

Anyways,for some reason oddly scared that the musty kids would assault me cause those fuckers were like the varsity football,soccer, and wrestling kids.I honestly have no clue why I was so scared of that happening, it's not like that I was ever assaulted before. The closest thing to assault that has happened to me is tripping,this one time this ugly fat-ass kid that was like a year younger (I believe) than me took his hand put it on my back and rubbed it down to my tailbone which was a quite sensory experience, I get tingles just thinking about it,and this other time this kid I was doing a sport with at the time was behind me, and was like rubbing my lower back, which was miserable, idk why people love touching my back so much.

Also I would like to say that those kids that I feared would assault me didn't really make threating gestures, minus this one shortie who is far to wimpy to hurt me for real, he would kick balls at me, and miss by a tiny bit just so he could try to scare me, unfortunately he was a bit late to the party.I gave up caring if I got hit by balls so long ago cause people threw them at me on purpose for like 3 years  before this moment, his dumbass gave up in like  3 weeks probably cause of my apathy.He also tried to trip me, which pissed me off so much cause it makes me think of people who ruined me and didn't suffer at all, I hope he lives a long miserable life for that.

I hate people.they never care, never they just wanna watch me suffer, I hope the kids live long lives so they can watch their bodies rot, and degrade until there weak as me and are unable to do anything physical, to make em feel so terrible that they were once the best physically in there lil world.

1ih53kx,choosing between your own pain or others,mentalillness,1738629853.0,0,1,"Ive attmepted 3 times before, at 13, 15 and 17 (about 7 months ago)

the closest to success of which was the most recent, it was early morning just as the sun was rising and i had been drinking in town with my bestfriend and idk what clicked but something hurt me more than it ever had before, i was in agony, an unbearable sense of pain i cant even describe. As i looked over the edge of the bridge i thought: ""this is it."" I was finally ready to do what i knew i had to for so long, the screaming and shouting of my bestfriend didnt bother me until before i went forward i took one last look at my bestfriend and the look on his face it scared me more than anything ever had before, and in that moment i knew, his pain was worse than mine.

idk what it would feel like to see someone you love die infront of you, he does hes already experienced that when he was younger with his mother dying of lets sat unnatural causes infront of him. As i looked at him through the snot and tears he yelped ""not again, just not you please."" In that moment i instantly stepped down and ran at him, i cradled him and held his hand and wiped his tears and all of a sudden my pain didnt matter to me any more, sure i could still feel the overwhelming pain flowing through my brain but i didnt care, not one bit. In that moment i only cared for him and how i could console him.

After that i felt numb for a while, i felt happy and relieved for once in my life. Seeing his horrified expression terrified me more than anything ever has before. I was truly scared straight. Even in my darkest moment i ignored my own pain and suffering for him and i dont regret it one bit.

But its still, now, an eternal struggle and every time i feel closer to wanting that relief again i think about how it would hurt him and it devours me whole. I feel as if im playing tug of war with my mind and almost that he is part of it. Regardless i love him, i love him more than anything in the world and if my eternal suffering means he can be happy then i suppose im gonna suffer for a hell of a lot longer.",life is unbearable

I stopped because my parents found out and I couldn‚Äôt bare to see them see more fresh scars so I stopped out of fear and then I‚Äôve not touched a blade in that way, minus the brief period of relapse shortly after without visible scars on my leg. 

I‚Äôm scared, because usually when I‚Äôve had thoughts of c//tting myself they‚Äôve been momentary, I know they‚Äôll pass, just the urge gets strong. Except the urge isn‚Äôt strong right now in this period of time, it‚Äôs come up a few times right before panic attacks but the planning, the made up scenarios of what would happen if I do do it have happened. Like intrusive thoughts except‚Ä¶ I lean into them. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm mentally preparing myself to get worse and need this tool again. Because the truth is, my mental health is shit again, the shittiest it has been since school, I opened up something inside of me and suddenly all this repressed anxiety has just made its way to the top and I don‚Äôt know what to do except actually deal with it because I can‚Äôt suppress it again, I want to get better. I‚Äôm receiving therapy so I CAN get better. 

People at my work know about my anxiety right now, I‚Äôve been trying to tell as many people as I can about my mental health so that they can support me so that it‚Äôs easier to look after myself. Even the store manager knows right now (she‚Äôs been super supportive and I really trust her). But fuck can they find out about these thoughts. There‚Äôs only one person I‚Äôd potentially trust with this information because she‚Äôs young but old enough that she‚Äôs more recovered from her anxiety, but I don‚Äôt want to worry her with this information and she is a supervisor despite the fact she‚Äôs very friendly with me and I worry that even mentioning something like this to her she‚Äôd have the duty to report it. I worry people will think I‚Äôm a danger to myself but right now I‚Äôm not, that‚Äôs the thing, I‚Äôm just growing increasingly worried that it‚Äôll only be a matter of time until I will be. How much anxiety and pain and suffering do I have to endure again to feel like I need to relapse to cope? Because everything is getting more serious, what was just more panic attacks and more anxiety has mentally drained me over the past few weeks and made me more actively process the trauma I‚Äôve been through because ultimately, that is the root reason as to why I‚Äôm doing this shit right now.

I‚Äôm scared though. I keep saying these are just thoughts and it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôll do anything but I have a blade in my bag. It‚Äôs from my past job, a box cutter, I need to get rid of it but idk how and where. And this is so stupid of me but I just picked it up and looked at it and I pressed my finger on the blade part and then really pressed down just to see how easily it COULD cut, and yes it‚Äôs very blunt but I figured with enough force and pressure it could do harm. I don‚Äôt know why I did it, I didn‚Äôt draw blood on my finger cause it wasn‚Äôt the attempt of self harm it was just seeing how easy or hard it would be to use and now I feel like an idiot and more of a danger to myself than I was because why would I absent mindedly do something like that? If I do that with barely any thought then what‚Äôs stopping me from making the first mark again? Then what? 

My partner doesn‚Äôt even know I‚Äôve had these thoughts and considerations, they‚Äôve heard when I‚Äôve had urges but nothing this serious because they know about my anxiety and if they know I‚Äôve had these thoughts it‚Äôll break them. I‚Äôm seeing them tomorrow and staying over theirs for a few nights and I don‚Äôt know what to do because what if I have these thoughts there?

And he says he bit his foot, but he's a liar, and he's known for being a liar in my town, and my dog doesn't bite people, he wagged his tail when that neighbour was around, and if you even move ur hand he runs away scared, anyways I was left speechless by what he says, and he then says ""go wait inside I'm going to shoot him and kill him"" I then say ""what no ur not"" and I bring my dog to my front gate, call my parents and my dad brings him to the vet, sadly there was a small chance that they could operate on his arm and he'll live, so we did the only right thing and ended his suffering with euthanasia, everyone's crying, my mother especially, I still can't believe he's dead, my dad came home and even he cried, last time he cried was when he found out my mother had cancer (thankfully she doesn't anymore) and I js know thst if I woke up at a reasonable time I could keep watch on him like I always do, and that's the reason I cut myself, and I js have no friends, no one likes me at school, only 2 or 3 people do out of 400 in the school, and they aren't even my friends, they can js tolerate my appearance, I'm lonely as fuck. I have kissed loads of girls at discos (which in ireland is called shifting) but never dated a girl, I find it really hard to cry now but if something so minor and small were to happen I would burst into tears, the only time I really thought about suicide was when my mind was fucked up the day after I smoked weed, all I do Is cut myself, and if anyone has advice how to cut ur forearms in summer please let me know.",cutting myself

oyfdcj,I cut myself for the first time today and i feel worse. Please help.,mentalillness,1628162011.0,24,123,"Im up at 5 am writing this because I can't sleep and anxiety is keeping me up. I'm a 17 year old girl and cut myself with a blade for the first time today. I have cut myself with scissors a few times, but I've been having a particularly rough time and couldn't resist the urges. I went to my friend's house bc I'd been laying in bed all day doing nothing and was feeling quite depressed. When I went to her house, she was building a model house which required the use of an exacto knife. Now before this, things had been getting better with my mental health and I hadn't SH'd in about a year, but when she left the room I decided to try it for real. I took her knife and ran it across my ankle and wrist. I'd been so scared to use a real knife until that moment, but I felt so much relief. That is until rn. I feel even worse and can't stop worrying about the scars I might end up with. I feel terrible for damaging my body but I feel like that's the only way to cope atm. 

Even though this was the first time I'd cut with an actual knife, I've been self harming since I was little. It started when I broke my elbow around age 6. After that, I became obsessed with casts and wanted to get more, so what other way to do that than to break my own bones. I ended up with about 7 casts after that point; almost all injuries self-inflicted. However, through the processing of self-injury my motives changed and I no longer wanted it for show, but was craving the pain and rush it gave me. After that, I started hitting myself on multiple occasions inflicting grapefruit-sized bruises on my body. I also started punching walls and may have done some damage to my knuckles as they would swell up to the size of golf balls. I also pick my skin and rip off my pinky toenails till they bleed.

I know it sounds like a lot, but I feel like I'm not doing enough and I deserve worse. I'm so ashamed of my actions and that I can never take them back, as the scars are a reminder of those mistakes. That's why I would bruise myself and break my bones; because it wouldn't leave a scar. I just reached the point where it was too much effort for the results I wanted, and cutting was just an easier alternative (although it leaves a permanent reminder).

I don't want any sympathy from this, but some reassurance would be appreciated. I'm seeing a therapist every couple weeks and I had been doing ""fine"" but have not yet reached the point of mental stability i had before. I've never felt the same as I did before junior year, and I miss feeling ok.",cutting myself

They've put me on a new medication that we all thought would work. I've felt so guilty for how I've made them felt.. and they seem so much happier now, living off false hope, that I'm getting better.

1jc2ez4,Is it normal that it‚Äôs taking 2-3 appointments to get anywhere with a depression screening?,therapy,1742065306.0,4,2,"So basically I‚Äôve been experiencing mild depression symptoms like low pleasure, rare/muted emotions, low motivation, and sometimes a weird heavy/tired feeling that makes getting work done even harder than it was before.

So I asked my counselor (he‚Äôs a Christian therapist because god forbid my parents let me see well-informed secular counselors‚Ä¶) if I could get a depression screening. He said yes, but I honestly think he‚Äôs being a little‚Ä¶ weird, about it?

Instead of getting right into the evaluation, he first gave me a list of photos and asked me which one I identified with the most. After that, he had me make a list of things weighing down on me. I thought nothing of it though. Maybe it‚Äôll help him get to the root of my problems or whatever, I thought. But I asked for this like 2 appointments ago, and we‚Äôre not getting anywhere and in one appointment we only cover like two entries from the list I wrote. Maybe it‚Äôs just part of the process? Also what makes this more frustrating is that appointments are monthly. I think I asked in like January of this year‚Ä¶

There are other weird things about this that don‚Äôt feel right. For instance, I told him that I rarely feel pleasure anymore, and he said that I could just be desensitized. But I don‚Äôt understand how I could be so desensitized to pleasure that I can‚Äôt find anything that makes me happy anymore. He also said that we‚Äôre content in Jesus only and how that‚Äôs probably part of why I feel this way. Uh‚Ä¶ sure, buddy.

Also as quick bonuses, there are two other things that make me think he doesn‚Äôt have the right education. He refers to hyperactive ADHD as hyperimpulsive ADHD, and I know it doesn‚Äôt sound like much, but I feel like he doesn‚Äôt have the right knowledge of ADHD. I also told him about my intrusive thoughts, and he thought that I genuinely wanted to punch people, despite making it as clear as possible that they were INTRUSIVE thoughts.

Now, I‚Äôm slowly coming out of depression, but life still feels overwhelming. I‚Äôve cut down everything.. no social life, no extra activities.. yet I still have no time. Work and sleep alone take 16 to 18 hours of my day. Cooking takes another 2 hours, commuting takes 2 more, and I also need time to study. Some days, I just want to cry because I feel like the weight of life is crushing me down. Just working, sleeping, traveling, eating, studying.. 24 hours doesn‚Äôt seem enough. God, how do I manage these basic, necessary things in my life?

But today, something unexpected happened. I was talking to my manager, just a typical work conversation, asking for guidance on some tasks. In the middle of it, he suddenly said:
""[My Name], you are one of the best assessors (my role).""
Then he continued, ""I don‚Äôt want to name anyone, but with others, I still discuss the basics. With you, I‚Äôm just fine-tuning.""

For a moment, I didn‚Äôt know how to respond. I thanked him and told him I was happy my work was being recognized. But honestly? It made me feel really good. After everything, after feeling like I was barely holding on, this small acknowledgment meant a lot. It reminded me that maybe, just maybe, I am doing something right.

I don‚Äôt know who to share this with, so I‚Äôm writing it here. If you‚Äôve read this far, thank you.",depressed

1jqwatq,"Guilt, anxious attachment and relationships",therapy,1743719438.0,1,1,"I am not sure where to start with this or what I am hoping for but i‚Äôve spent a lot of time (too much time) finding and reading posts on Reddit that resonate with me in some way. 

I (mid-twenties woman) grew up with an emotionally distanced father whose love and attention was unpredictable - his moods were very volatile and he would get angry easily. I felt that things were calmer at home if we (my family - all female) prioritised his needs and emotions. I was more likely to receive affection if I was behaving well, performing well in school, being submissive. I was never a badly behaved kid - I can‚Äôt think of one serious ‚Äòmistake‚Äô I made as a child because I always put my father‚Äôs needs first. Even from a young age I felt very conscious of this and had a lot of pressure on me to mature early on and to be the ‚Äògolden‚Äô eldest child. 

My dad was diagnosed with cancer when I was young and died when I was 19. This of course affected my family relations and the atmosphere at home. He was very depressed and was undergoing a lot of very difficult treatment and medication. My parents tried to protect us from acting like everything was ‚Äònormal‚Äô but I think this caught up with me later (and right now). I didn‚Äôt fully appreciate until a few months before he died that he was going to die. I felt so stupid when I realised the truth. I understand my dad‚Äôs behaviour and I do miss him but I also hold a lot of anger and feel that I have only been able to exist as myself since he died‚Ä¶

I am currently at a top university and my life is going relatively well. Sometimes I question whether I would be here if I hadn‚Äôt had so much pressure on me as a child. I‚Äôm not sure if I would have chosen this path for myself. 

Recently (last 6 months) I have been reflecting on all this, and obsessively so. I know I have an anxious attachment style. This has caused lots of problems for me, particularly in my dating life. I am currently in a healthy and happy relationship but there was a period in my life, around 3 years ago, when I had such an unhealthy attitude towards men, relationships, dating etc. 

During this time I felt like I was catching up on my ‚Äòmissed‚Äô teenage years. Being rebellious, having casual sex, and just doing stuff that I couldn‚Äôt have done in the past. But it‚Äôs only recently that i‚Äôve appreciated how desperate I was to be loved and how lonely I felt all the time. I was scared of asking people for respect, love, or even just expressing how I feel out of fear of pushing someone away.

I was in one ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô that was very short-lived and unhealthy. This man was a few years older than me, basically used me for somewhere to crash and said some very problematic things that fuelled my anxiety/ fears mentioned above. His values and attitude did not align with mine at all and yet I bowed and scraped to him because I felt like the only alternative was abandonment or that I wouldn‚Äôt find anyone else. I felt like that‚Äôs all I deserved. 

I won‚Äôt list all the things that happened but he was very unkind and took advantage of me - my friends hated him. And I fucked up. When he threatened to leave, I freaked out and lied that I was pregnant. I was doing all sorts of mental gymnastics to make sure he wouldn‚Äôt leave me. I told him and my friends that I had an abortion because I knew no one would question it. I felt like he might finally care about me, that I had given him the opportunity to show he cares. I very quickly realised that this wouldn‚Äôt work, he didn‚Äôt ‚Äòprove himself‚Äô and I didn‚Äôt feel better. 

Two years later and I am haunted by this. I am so disturbed by my own actions and disappointed on so many levels - that I wanted to please someone like that and that I was willing to tell such a lie (also to my friends). 

Every day I am haunted by memories of this, by guilt. I am obsessed with thinking about all my past mistakes (not just this but this is the ‚Äòmain‚Äô thing). I am ashamed of my behaviour at that time, I am realising for the first time how low my self-esteem has been my whole life. I also feel ashamed that I only feel that i‚Äôve grown since being in my current relationship, which was also unexpected. I feel like i‚Äôm only a better person because of my boyfriend and that I‚Äôm always dependent on someone. 

I recently told my close friend about this lie and she just laughed and was said ‚Äòhe deserved it‚Äô. I should be glad she said that but i‚Äôm not. And if i‚Äôm not thinking about this then i‚Äôm thinking about something else I did wrong - friendships that ended, other childish behaviours, not being good enough.

I have started meditating which has helped a bit. I had a couple of therapy sessions through my university but that ended. I am scared to tell a therapist all my feelings and it‚Äôs so hard to explain. My mind is so active and I and always full of guilt. 

Also - felt that background was relevant and my anxious attachment style and low self-confidence from my childhood explains a lot. But maybe it doesn‚Äôt and i‚Äôm just looking for an excuse for my mistakes.

1jb9m6b,Anxious and stressed in between sessions after a rupture,therapy,1741973768.0,3,1,"Rupture might be too dramatic of a term. I‚Äôve been with my therapist for over 5 years and imo we have a very strong alliance.

Please note that there‚Äôs quite a lot that I‚Äôm leaving out. But part of the gist is that she expressed confusion because I‚Äôd talked to my psychiatrist about how I‚Äôd been feeling really depressed. I wasn‚Äôt intentionally keeping this depression from my T, but idk I guess I didn‚Äôt communicate with her about it, or something got lost in translation.

When she shared her confusion, I interpreted it as an accusation that I had nefarious or manipulative intentions, which was not the case. I'm assuming this is from transference to be explored.

I could feel my whole body tense up. I went from laying down to sitting up straight. I felt defensive but also panicked. Iirc I may have cried but that‚Äôs a blur tbh.

My next session is on Tuesday, and I feel so anxious and stressed about the whole thing.

I emailed my therapist after, but instead of unloading my feelings in that email, I asked her if she could challenge me to sit with my feelings until Tuesday. Idk I felt the urge to contact her and I figured that was a happy medium.

I think there‚Äôs a lot going on with me right now - I‚Äôm having trouble at work for the first time in my job, which adds to the stress and anxiety. These experiences have left me scared that I‚Äôm really unstable and a bad person.

I know that Tuesday is just around the corner, but waiting - on top of all of my feelings - is agonizing.

1hheiw2,I have anxious attachment ,therapy,1734563259.0,4,7,"So I made a posts a few months back believing I may have narcissism after destroying a 5 year long friendship. Luckily yall assured me that I wasn't and made a really good point that narcissist are not really self-aware. However, two or three pointed out that I may have something called ""severe anxiety attachment disorder"". I'll be honest I never looked too deeply into it afterwards. Until recently I started to look into it. Everything I read definitely matched up to my behavior. Everything was more in line with ""preoccupied attachment style"" specifically.

For more context, I was OBSESSED with our friendship. I treated it like it could keep everything together and that it would fix everything. I demanded constant attention, validation and everything in-between. Never gave her own space. Never respected her boundaries. Worse of all I was extremely jealous. Everything went downhill when one day I thought she was talking to somebody and not me. In short. I began to harass her by calling her constantly which she understandably blocked my number. She ended up breaking our friendship but I just continued to stalk and harass(no way of sugarcoating it). In my mind I justify this by thinking ""I only want to talk her"". Also NEVER stalk or harass anybody no matter how you justify it. I eventually did stop, I won't lie though I still take a peep at her profile. 

Since then, though, I have been reading up more about my problems. Happy to say I can pinpoint things and finally heal. Bought a book about anxious attachment which honestly helped a lot, I do plan buying another. I have been avoiding her profile, though I have strong urges to look. Still I haven't looked for awhile. Made a new friend since then which I have been showing her love in a healthier manner. Been respecting boundaries, given them space, and haven't felt an ounce of jealousy. I'm finally slowly healing from my mental anguish. As for my ex best friend. I miss her dearly, we've been through so much together. It still hurts to think about her.

I relapsed back into some intrusive thoughts and anxiety from some events that happened piling on top of each other. I didn't want it to get too much again, so I figured I would try it out.

The thing about it is- I have felt much relief from getting a different perspective from someone else, and to see how events in my life contributed to the feelings I have today. That made my mind more clear.

To note- I am very self aware, in fact, too self aware for my own good which is a part of my overanalyzing and hyperfixating, mostly of health anxiety. So when I speak to him, I feel like I am just rehashing everything over and over again. I don't even have much to say at this point, our last 4 sessions have been duds and quite frankly just talked mostly about music and life. I expressed to him how distressed I am most days from my own thoughts, and he just gives me sympathies and tells me it's from my past and my family. I understand this, but what does that to do help me? I already knew that before I went to him. He encourages independence and suggests I move out of my house because I'm breathing the trauma filled air of my family, which is valid, but I expressed that quite frankly I do not have the money to do so and it would be a while. That is his only solutions to what I've expressed to him. Everytime I tell him what's going on he tells me the solution is to move out and that i talk about the same things , he wants me to have different things to talk about, when i move out, like what im going to cook, if i feel alone etc. I've made it very clear that I would like to put in the work and want tools to remedy the intrusive thought cycles. I've gotten nothing. The other odd thing is that when I express to him that I've been doing just fine lately he tries to pry it out of me that talking to him is helping. I'm not saying it hasn't helped, I have gone out by myself, I have just been normal, but I still have ruminating thoughts that have not been touched on or remedied at all and that's the sole reason I am going to therapy in the first place.

  
He's a very kind man. But he leaves a lot of silent spaces, and says he wants me to feel okay to be silent while we look at one another. But I don't see how it helps and he just waits for me to start talking of something else, or he's asked, why don't you ask me a question?

Anyone have thoughts on this? Honestly I feel stuck because I think he's very nice, but I don't know how to say that i don't think this is working.

I have been an intensive gamer for pretty much my entire life since I was around 8 or 9 and have an extreme case of gaming addiction. It was originally thought I was extremely introverted but after working almost a full year straight at a major retail store I feel like this was just another element of my life that had been affected by my addiction. 


I feel hopeless and hate myself. I accepted years ago that I am the cause of my own failure in life but do not believe I am capable of putting the pieces back together again. I lack many of the basic life skills almost every other individual has such as the ability to tie my own shoes or manage my own finances or even operate an oven and even lack a drivers permit. I don't feel like I have the potential to develop. I feel like I fell into the trope of ‚Äúenjoying the present and sacrificing the future.‚Äù Only the present ended several years ago and the future is already here. It took me almost 2 years just to get a job with almost no other development occurring. 

My social life is non-existent outside of my workplace and even there I do not understand how I am supposed to move beyond the friendly coworker stage into actually making friendships with the people I like. At the same time though I understand any friendships I could make would be unfair to others as I have almost nothing to offer. Up until a few years ago it never really bothered me too much. But the last several years I seem to be increasingly lonely and online interactions are no longer helping. I don't want to be alone forever but have to accept that I have no value to anyone else in the real world or the social abilities needed for anything other than friendly conversations with co-workers who I know dont really care at the end of the day. 

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. I feel like I will never be able to get better or at the very least it would take the majority of my lifespan to do so which seems like a crappy amount of time to spend being a burden to society.

Because of them insisting I in fact broke down and made myself feel emotions that were not even there originally, because I thought to myself that I am not feeling better because I am not listening to them and they are professionals and are perhaps right. It made me way worse. 

I am diagnosed with a personality disorder and adhd. History of trauma and ab*se. I‚Äôve been making hints that I suspect being on the spectrum, because there‚Äôs a lot of relatable points -  since childhood. Two weeks ago I brought 7 filled in ASD tests - and it was obvious that it was incredibly difficult for me to have this conversation, because I was worried I will be seen as complicated and demanding etc. , then he assured me I can share it with him. 

Well let‚Äôs say that it didn‚Äôt go very well. The team decided that getting an assessment is not important. While they all see and agree that I am not getting better and am not making progress. My point being that perhaps if they have no knowledge or experience regarding how neurodiverse brains work, it is simply not gonna get through to me‚Ä¶
 
Anyway this information (assessment not being important) brought up some intense emotions in me. I've been having daily meltdowns since then. He asked me why, if I feel rejected? That is the thing - they work with me from the perspective that I am feeling rejected and therefore upset. I don't feel rejected. I feel misunderstood and helpless, hopeless. Because I don't know how to tell them. They tell me to talk about things that bother me. But when I do, it is not ok and I have no capacity and tolerance for holding negative emotions? I am confused, I don't know what to do. And quite frankly, I haven't felt so uncomfortable in a very long time. It was like being scolded by a parent. 


There‚Äôs so many things I want to write here to clarify and explain, but we would be here till the next century. 

Bottom line - I am trying my best to communicate and figure out ways how to make stuff work, while am being perceived as complicated, not willing to cooperate and not respecting their boundaries and the therapist was very visibly frustrated. Asking me what do I want then from the talk therapy?! (while two weeks prior he said it is not a talk therapy‚Ä¶). And again, this makes me very upset, because I‚Äôve been obviously trying to tell them. My complaints are not just complaints. They hold information. But it is perhaps perceived simply as me being an as****e. 

I don't even know what I need from people now. Perhaps just let me know if I am being really so terrible, or if they simply don't get me. ",hopeless
1b0b8rk,I had been feeling hopeless and reached out over email (for the first time) to my therapist of 3 years and the response I got back upset me. ,therapy,1708930531.0,4,2,"
I asked her when I first started seeing her if I could email her in desperate times because it‚Äôs something I‚Äôd done with my past two therapists. My second therapist was amazing with it, she wouldn‚Äôt respond to anything in the email directly but she‚Äôd thank me for sharing with her and said something like ‚Äúwe can certainly address this in the next session.‚Äù The simple act of thanking me meant so much to me. 

It‚Äôs been three years since I‚Äôve been seeing this ‚Äúnew‚Äù therapist and I just now felt the need to reach out. I hit an extreme low for the first time in years. I went out on a limb and said ‚ÄúI know you can‚Äôt respond to the contents of this directly but I would appreciate it if you let me know you got this and saw it‚Äù because my first therapist wouldn‚Äôt respond at all to my emails and I realized after my second therapists way of handling this, that no response made me feel uncertain. I remember pointing this out to her when I asked for permission to email her. 

She responded, and I‚Äôm trying to tell myself maybe it‚Äôs just because it was late, but she was very, very short. Like, she took out pronouns which is a short way of speaking and now I‚Äôm worried I crossed a line or upset her. I feel unsafe. I worry she is mad at me. I worry I did too much. I just desperately needed help and didn‚Äôt expect therapy through email, just a kind acknowledgment that I expressed something we can talk about in person. 

She also pointed out my hinting toward self ‚Äúdestructive‚Äù thoughts and directed me to help lines, which I want no part of. They do not help me. I was emailing her because I wanted her help (to be clear, within the confines of the session) not someone whose sole goal is to keep me alive.

1ai80cz,i (23m) have been depressed for about 3-5 years since highschool and reading about depression in the internet makes me feel really hopeless,therapy,1706999107.0,3,1,"i feel like a lot of ppl who complain of depression will say that its stuck with them forever or that theyre born with it or something, but this really frustrates me because it doesnt feel like my experience at all and it just makes me feel so hopeless that ill never go backk to normal. i dont think theres something wrong with my brain making my trapped like this, i think i have way too much unprocessed emotional baggage and deep-seeded negative beliefs about myself.

most of my life i didnt feel depressed and i enjoyed things and was excited by things. it was only until highschool senior year or so, i started feeling depression symptoms. around that time i feel like i experienced more emotional loss than most ppl do in their entire life time. i would socially blunder catastrophicslly to the point where i had a whole army of people hate me. I had back to back traumatic relationships since i had seriously bad attachment problems, and i lost all my friends and my girlfriend at the time who felt like my first real love. meanwhile, i never really felt like i had a family, my parents are wuite emotionally immature and my sister seems to have BPD and maybe NPD and im scared of her. after this point i started to feel utterly alone, i relied entirely on my friends for social support cuz i have no real connection to wny of my fsmily.

i felt optimistic the summer after senior year highschool that ill make friends again in college, meanwhile i ignored everything that happened in highschool. wasnt able to really make friends, then covid happened and that stopped me even more from making friends and thats when i really started to feel hopeless. in addition i developed a pretty debilitating OCD theme with germaphobia. id wash my fwce for an hour wt w time, wear a gas mask everywhere, wash my hands till they were bleeding, etc. in addition ocd aggravating my family issues. my life started to feel really bleak and i started developing a significant depression at this point. 

school went back in person, at this point i was really optimistic hoping to finally make friends to make up for the friends that i lost since highschool, but my OCD was still really bad and that made it really hard to meet ppl and pushed ppl away. I was too afraid to go near ppl. and then i stopped talking to my only real friends at the time too, and thats when my depression became extremely severe

i desperately sought help from a university therapist and i landed in the mental hospital. since then (2 years ago) i was really motivated to fix my life.

i reconnected with a lot of people who i missed and thought hated me, felt a little better. i reslly pushed myself to socialize mu h more in college and i got a girlfriend but that didnt work out and i was devastated and decided to try therapy for these issues for the first time. i also worked on my germaphobia a lot to where i was mostly normal.

i was really mtiivated and talked to this therapist, i did research between sessions and journaled a lot and read self help books. however it was never a good fit and i feel like i was mostly fiving myself therapy. i stayed so long because i felt like i had no other emotional connections. despite this not being a good fit, because i was so motivated and did my own research, i improved my own dwpression from extremely severe to about moderate-severe. i also spoke with a psychologist soecializing in ocd and he said my ocd is now considered subckinical. i conquoted my severe ocd.

6 months ago i started family therapy and she is actully quite good, this helped me resolve some family problems and i feel more grateful for how my family is. i worked on my fears about my family. my family therapist had always offered support through emails even if its not strictly about family therapy. she helped me decide i needed ti change individual therapists.

i am now deciding on a new therapist.

i feel like i know why i feel depressed, its a lot and complex reasons, i just need to process it all still. i am heavily considering this one therapist i spoke with, i felt energized after our sessions and felt like i was able to talk about emotions i had been suppressing for years. this is way faster progress i made with my old therapist who i felt unable to talk about my past with. i am depressed for soecific reasons and in getting a lot better. i will conquor this like i did my ocd. i know i can go back to normal. it pisses me off ppl act like they are powerless to their sepression. 

today i felt more hopeless than normal but i know i can improve and go back to normal. i know that i can figure out the core reasons why i feel depressed and resolve them. i know that one day i will be symptom free of this longstanding episode and be in full remission. it gives me anxiety seeing ppl treat it like its lifelong and it iesnt even seem accurate to see it that way since i have made so much improvement.",hopeless

It's a mix between shame and longing I think. I'm a white Australian and my ethnicity is very mixed, as my ancestors came from all over Europe. Some were 
convicts, some had to flee the Scottish Highlands during the highland clearances, some came over to Australia during waves of mass migration in the early 1900s from Wales & England, so I don't have any strong ties to any particular nationality or culture.

 I feel like white Australian culture is pretty non-existant. It's sterile and I feel isolated & neglected from those that are meant to be my family and community. I don't feel any sense of solidarity like I see in different cultures. I feel like I don't belong. I don't agree with the views many white Australians have.

I feel continually deeply ashamed by what my ancestors did to the indigenous people of Australia. Every time I learn something new about the history, I feel sick inside and strong disgust. I feel a rot growing inside and it makes me feel worthless and disgusting to be white. It's so dumb but I feel jealous at times of people with rich cultural ties. I want to belong somewhere and be proud of who I am, and where I come from. I'm very grateful to be born somewhere safe and Australia is such a beautiful country. I love the land and nature here and feel very privileged. I just can't stop this feeling. 

The other day I was discussing how I sometimes drink cacao (a traditional South American drink) to my lecturer and she judged me for culturally appropriating. I felt so terrible after and began questioning if I'd done something wrong. Either way it made me feel so ashamed of myself, so disgusted.  I'm crying while I write this because it really affects me. Sometimes I think I deserve it or something for being white and then I feel ridiculous for thinking I'm some victim.

I cry easily. I know it's a problem I'm very aware of it and struggle with dealing with it. The second she started asking a few serious questions I was crying. I know it's frustrating but she was absolutely annoyed about it. Explaining how I should stop and just speak to her normally because we don't have much time and she would like to end the call asap.

It was awful. She interrupted me in every sentance so I didn't feel like I was being heard or listened to. And told me I would be better off in a hospital so I can get given medication. Im not a doctor but talking to someone openly who could understand my problems a bit would already help me a lot. I don't want to be put on any medication before that as I know my problems are large but fixable.

Anyways she ended the call after 15 min saying we aren't a good fit. I agree but she just said many things that were just awful. And then with just a simple good bye she hung up.

Now I just don't think I have it in me to call someone else. I know I should but it took me months to build up enough courage to call this person. So the thought of a second person saying I'm not worth the effort professionally is enough to make me seriously wonder if its even worth me existing enough to try.",worthless
16z3wms,feelings of apathy/ worthlessness/ lack of motivation caused by extreme levels of pessimism,therapy,1696368113.0,0,2,"I graduated from the college 4 months ago. I'm struggling to find a damn job in my 3rd world country with high unemployment rates. I'm not even looking for jobs in my very niche field of study(which I could never find a job). I just want to find a darn minimum wage job but still can't get it. I'm demoralized by all of it. I'm at a point where I don't want to work even if they give me a job. 

Study 4 years of university, spend weeks with no sleep, write long essays, read a lot of books. What for? Ignorant low education people with money doesn't even see me worthy of being a cashier for their crappy bussinesses. I would gladly join to a buddhist monastery at the top of a mountain and become a monk if my country had any of them but sadly it don't. I hate the money, I hate materialistic society. I'm sick of this society which values material possesions and looks over goodness and virtue. I'm sick of human nature.

Are you hungry? Need money. Are you sick? Need money. Are you in love? She won't even see you as a human if you don't have a well paying job or aren't attractive. Do you want to play an instrument or do something fun as a hobby? Need money. Do you want to go to gym? Need money for a healthy diet, proteins etc. Do you need money? Need a job. Need a job? too bad you ain't even worthy of being a wageslave. 

Best thing I could do is read some philosophy books and think about life in my room at my parents house all day. Life is really cruel, it is really funny how people with rich families think they are hot sh\*t for being successful.

I have zero motivation to even lift my finger. Sometimes I could go a week without showering. Sometimes I eat out of boredom even if I'm not hungry. Sometimes I don't even want to eat anything whole day. I sleep all day, etc.

What is the best thing I can do? Try to COPE with spiritualist teachings that say this life doesn't matter? Embrace the nihilism? Accept that I'm a failure and live in my parents house then become a 50 years old virgin neet? These are 3 solutions I can think of. ",worthless

1gcrwtd,Seeing a therapist has made self-harm harder to do. How else do I cope with having failed at life if I can't punish myself with self-harm? What action do I take to rectify being a failure? What is happening to me?,therapy,1729968291.0,17,7,"I feel like seeing a therapist is causing me a dilemma I don't know how to resolve. For 20 years, I have been seeing therapists, and for more than 20 years, I have struggled with self-harm. I have always used self-harm as a form of punishment for failure. This was the core of the abuse I endured as a child. I was diagnosed early on with Autism/PDD, epilepsy, a speech impairment, and a language disorder, and anytime I made a mistake or failed, I was beaten, whipped, raped, etc. Since around Grade 4 (maybe age 9?), I began to self-harm to punish myself for being a failure (I am almost 34 now). My body is heavily scarred from years of self-harm. 

I have been seeing this therapist for more than a year now. I feel like I have connected with her better than anyone else. I have told her more about the abuse I endured as a child than anyone ever. She seems to understand me well. 

Self-harm...doesn't feel right anymore. I am a failure, and I deserve to be punished, but when I try to do it, it doesn't happen. There is a mental block that wasn't there before. 

For example, I am fat and ugly. Recently, I was diagnosed with EDNOS/Atypical Anorexia, and I have been going to the gym regularly to be less fat and ugly. Today at the gym, I failed on the dumbbell chest press (I couldn't do 10 reps x 3 sets; I did 10 reps, 10 reps, then 7-8, at 110lbs), and I failed at the circuit (15 pushups, 10 bicep curls, and 15 crunches, x 3 reps), both of which I have done before. This is a failure. The last time I was at the gym, I failed the pull-ups. There are way better-looking and way stronger people at the gym than me. I will never look like them or be as strong as them. This is an inherent defect in me. I came home from the gym and tried to start cutting, but it didn't work. I couldn't overcome that mental block even though I deserve to be punished for failure. 

I feel like I am in limbo. I was in the ER in July, and now I can't even do a simple punishment for gym failure. 

If I can't punish myself for being a failure, what do I do about being a failure? I am objectively a failure‚ÄîI failed in school, I failed at weight loss, I failed in my non-existent career, I failed at making friends, etc. 

What do I do about being a failure if I don't self-harm? How come I suddenly can't do this? What is this mental block?

1ifh84h,Should I fire my therapist due to political differences or try to see multiple therapists at the same time?,therapy,1738446217.0,23,1,"Hello All,

I (31F) am posting this from a new account for privacy. I'm sorry for the novel. I wanted to include all relevant details. I both want advice and am looking to vent my frustration.

Like the many of the latest posters to this subreddit, I too am considering finding a new therapist due to political differences regarding the current political climate. So here is my situation:

I've been seeing my present therapist for a few months and she's been really helping me out with my ADHD, depression, autism, and to some degree anxiety. Her specialty is in autism as she has a daughter with autism. I don't really feel like she's helping with my trauma issues and political/climate related anxiety. I also suspect that I have ptsd, and feel like I haven't really gotten the chance to even begin to discuss that in sessions.

Most recently I brought up my concerns about the current administration, my fears of fascism, the horror at the effects of Trump policies, and my fear that we are never going to have another election. I feel like she was dismissive of my concerns, not out of spite or malice though. I do think she was really trying to help me. She basically responded that she was confident that there will be another election in four years, that she's seen many presidents come and go and that this one is no different, and that changes in president have never affected her (so I guess she's assuming that they won't affect me either?? - both of us are white fyi). She said that since I've already done in her words ""the most important thing"" - voting - and that there's nothing more I can do for the next four years. I brought up how Elon Musk threw a Nazi salute and how watching that felt like a punch to the chest. She responded by being slightly shocked or outraged and asked me ""Did you hear what he said before that? He said his heart goes out to all you"", said that there were memes of AOC doing a Nazi salute-like gesture, and that while she didn't think either person is a Nazi, that I'm just being manipulated by the media, both sides of which are pushing people to ideological extremes. She said that evil is everywhere and gave the example of Iceland aborting fetuses with down syndrome. I said that was in no way comparable to people killing living humans and she balked and began to start to protest that unborn babies are alive. At this point I was like why am I debating political issues with my therapist, and tried to redirect the conversation by saying like regardless of how you feel about when life starts, the current political climate in America is very concerning.

I also brought up climate change and the existential threat that poses and how I wasn't sure how to reconcile that with daily life, but she just dismissed it, saying ""oh well in the '60s and '70s people were sure that world was going to end because of the nuclear weapons crisis to and this is no different and will too pass"". I just didn't even know how to respond to that.

She wanted me to completely detach from news and current events for at least one month, including not talking about politics with my (likeminded) boyfriend at all, to see if it helped my anxiety. While she *may* be right that this is what I need, I currently don't feel like I can do that. Maybe I would feel differently if that advice came from someone who agrees with me or at least isn't dismissive. I mentioned that I wanted to be informed on changes for safety and preparedness reasons, but she just said that if there are any significant changes coming through that would affect me that I'd know about them. However, if I'm staying away from the news and not talking with anyone about politics or current events, how would I know?

One other thing I told her is that me and my boyfriend bond over politics and that it brings us together, it is literally the most important value to both of us. She just said to ""find something else to bond over"". I mean yeah, having an additional thing to bond over would be good for our relationship, but why abandon what has worked in the past?

One thing that occurred to me is that maybe I should see different therapists for separate issues. I know that this is very unpopular because of potentially competing or contradictory strategies. But please hear me out. Why don't we treat therapists like doctors? Doctors have different specialties and we see different doctors for different things. Therapists also have different specialties. Doctors coordinate care with each other, so why can't therapists coordinate mental health care with each other? I'm interested in seeing multiple therapists concurrently. Is it possible? A good idea? How should I talk to therapists about wanting to do this?

There are very few or maybe even no therapists that are experts in all of the various issues I have, even extending beyond in person therapy to online only therapists. Even fewer if I want to use my insurance and I do need to do that because money. I have ADHD and autism which have only been diagnosed in adulthood and because of that I've developed very differently, then someone who had the resources an early diagnosis can bring. I also have hoarding disorder, shopping addiction, agoraphobia, childhood and adult trauma, general and social anxiety, year-round major depressive disorder as well as severe seasonal/winter depression. I come from a family with a few alcoholics and am probably genetically predisposed to addiction. I've managed to avoid any drug or alcohol addictions up until now (I'm 31). In the last few months, I have started to use alcohol to cope with my increased anxiety and feeling of despair.¬† I've gone from 0-5 drinks a month to a couple a day and worry about becoming addicted. I suspect that I have PTSD and C-PTSD as well, from multiple different life events. My father died when I was very young and I was separated from half of my family. I am a survivor of childhood neglect and abuse and malnourishment, prenatal abuse - suffocation of my mother before I was born, poverty, and adult sexual/domestic abuse. My bio and step parents also have many similar issues and disorders to mine which are/were untreated (ADHD, autism, hoarding, alcoholism, abuse, narcissism, PTSD, trauma, both surviving and perpetrating abuse).

I am also Bisexual/Pansexual, Polyamorous, Jewish, a practicing witch, far left politically, and want someone who can acknowledge the effects of oppressive systems on mental health and who has the tools to help mitigate those effects. I am also an unapologetic former sex-worker whose experiences within that realm were a net positive and I‚Äôm still glad I did it. I spent an entire session explaining to my current therapist that no I really wasn‚Äôt (by and large) hurt by sex work. It was really annoying and not what I wanted to discuss at all. I had only wanted to bring it up to make sure that I could be honest with her and that she‚Äôd maintain professionalism. Lol.

I am employed in a stressful and physical blue collar 98% male dominated field whose male workers are already marginalized by society (construction). I have very good reasons for not wanting to leave my position or industry, however it is isolating and stressful. It‚Äôs hard to get most people in my life, including my therapist, to understand my motivations and the unique challenges of my industry and being who I am in it.

If I only see one therapist, then I need someone with a diverse skill set, who is *very* open-minded, and who can address co-occurring issues/diseases/conditions and understands how these things affect each other.

I don‚Äôt want to have to keep anything back from my therapist, because I don‚Äôt feel like they can help me if I can‚Äôt be honest with them or if they are judgemental. Finding someone who can help me with all of that seems almost impossible.

I also usually prefer to see women therapists over men. Maybe I‚Äôd be ok with a non-cis/straight man though.

1iruos2,I think that I'm a stalker.,therapy,1739825979.0,13,6,"I think that I'm a stalker and I want help. Not help with stalking others, but mental help to stop my stalking behaviours. I'm very worried about bringing it up to my therapy team, though. I'm not sure if my behaviours are bad enough, if they'll take me seriously, or if I'll get reported and receive a fourth safeguarding order. 

My stalking behaviours: I keep everything non-gross that my stalkees(?) give me, even if it's just a blank paper or a broken chain. I make notes of every interaction I have with them, as well as every interaction that I see them having with others. I obsessively google search them, go through their social media accounts, and spend hours scrolling to find information on and pictures of them. I save and screenshot everything of or related to them that I can. I sometimes go to places that they frequent in hopes that I'll see them there. I watch them from afar if I see them somewhere but can't go talk to them. I write down every piece of information that I learn about them. 

Things that people should probably know: I am a teenager. I am in therapy, but my therapy team‚ÄîI assume‚Äîwould be useless in treating something like stalking. I am UK-based. I have a safety plan already. I have a diagnosis for ASD. My father was a stalker, and he stalked me for six years. The rest of my family consists of alcoholics and drug addicts. 

More relevant information: I only feel urges to stalk people that I idolise or love. I have behaviours that I think may be related to my stalking behaviours, such as me abusing alcohol to cope with the anxiety and distress that I feel when I can't be near my love interests. The stalking behaviours started when I was a preteen and have been slowly getting worse. They have never escalated past what I described, but I'm scared that I may become as bad a stalker as my father was. 

I think that I'm looking for advice on how to stop these behaviours, how to tell my therapist, and what to look for when looking for another therapist specifically to help me with stopping my stalking behaviours and unhealthy obsessions. I really want to be a good person.

He has been going for about a year and in that time I have gone in with him twice, once to meet her and again for a couples session. The session felt like just a conversation, not like any therapy I've ever been to. It didn't feel like work was happening. Afterwards I was super disappointed and told my husband as much. He says that they do real work and that she's helping him so I dropped it. If it's helping him I'm good with it. But ...

He keeps asking me to go back in. I feel awful telling him no, but I just can't agree to it. I don't want to go in there and mess up his relationship with his therapist or ruin the experience for him. I'm also worried it'll feel like he and his therapist are ""ganging up"" on me.

Now its a little over six years and the first 2 - 3 years were rough, I figure for most. After that, I got drawn towards some bad influence, started drinking way more, doing impulsive things whenever and wherever, and just kind of messing around with various women. I didn't mind it and, at the time, it brought me some weird sense of peace I guess. Now, the last year I've been trying to change my act, I've gone back to college, after dropping out have an okay Job and have been trying to get closer to God, which I kind of just forgot ir didn't really care for religion after my dad died. The last few weeks I've just been thinking about my pops way more than normal and not that it's a bad thing but like I just feel super empty and sad and depressed when I wasn't that way before. I don't know if I'm making sense. I just dont know who to really talk about this with IRL because it seems like my family grieved ""properly"".

I had a therapy session today and it ended pretty early because I couldn't think of what to talk about  or what to say. All I know is I feel depressed, anxious, numb and just really bad about myself. They ask  me what I'm thinking, what I'm feeling and I don't know what to say or how to describe anything. They ask if there is anything I want to talk about or add anything they should know. It feels like a chore to even think or talk, what am I supposed to say? I don't know why I feel the way I do and I don't know how to talk about any of it. I feel like I'm probably a very frustrating client. I'm sick of being told I'm bipolar from psychiatrists and then told I have PTSD like symptoms, some kind of depressive disorder and generalized anxiety from therapists. How am I supposed to know what's wrong with me and how to get better when no one seems to agree on what I actually have. I feel empty inside and that's it.

Whenever I am not working or doing something productive, I always end up looking or seeing other people more productive than me or better than me at a certain skill, and envy boils inside of me as I view them. Whenever I try to progress a skill, it feels pointless as I lack the drive or intrinisic motivation to put 100% of my effort into it. For example, I recently picked up the saxophone and was really happy to see my progress, only for it to be crushed by looking at an audition piece for a tenor sax part in an orchestra my friend is in. My parents also ignore me and tend to wave these ""minor"" phases out of the way, saying that if I try my best and continue to be a good person, everything will turn in my favour. Whenever I talk, they ignore me or undermine my words, and whenever I try to establish some form of dominance or respect, they either laugh or discipline me. I feel really disheartened about all these things and they honestly make me feel like all my progress, effort, and skill is gone to waste by putting it in a meat sack like myself.

I have been struggling with the traumatic and unforeseen death of my mother that I witnessed a year ago. Including several integral losses just before and after my mom dying she was aware of‚Ä¶ I have had a long history of c-ptsd and found trusting MH difficult. My counsellor of several years was a source of support following her death, in my time working with this counsellor she had crossed many boundaries including breaching confidentiality, boundary violations and oversharing. Initially, I was thinking given my profession she was seeing me more like a colleague but as time went on there was a dependency she developed and I guess as of late with the loss of my mom I developed. I went to see her for somatic experiencing to move trauma outside of my body as my voice was impacted due to trauma silencing and I couldn‚Äôt share my narrative easily. 

During our time she would repeatedly make assumptions about how I feel and reacted, even making culturally inappropriate jokes towards me as a form of banter. She even showed pics of her pre and post breast reduction surgery (clothed). I have been very harmed in my life by people and she would repeatedly share she was modelling loving relationships with me. I have never had any sexual, maternal or obsessive feelings for this person strictly platonic. When I had almost died from postpartum complications she was a source of support she shared, but when I shared my need to connect with a new Counsellor to work on my grief as her waitlist was 3 months she became insulting and shared our relationship was unhealthy for her and she wanted to contain it to her work week when she was connecting with me for months no formalized appointments. When I tried to explain I understood the need for us to have trauma stewardship she became very harmful and cruel to me. She even sent me a termination email with no referral supports and a tv show quote after I asked her to stop contacting me she was being hurtful and confusing. She even minimized the value of my cultural understandings of relational accountability (Indigenous)

I am now struggling to feel safe to seek counselling support as this time in need to be well for my child and family. I really want to get help and people are trying to force me to report this counsellor but all I want to do is find a counsellor I can trust to do the healing work in need so very desperately.",feeling empty

1jjazh9,How do I move on from my ‚Äúbroken‚Äù family and get rid of my high expectations of having a family unit?,therapy,1742875798.0,1,2,"Hello everyone. I want to reach out and see if anyone has been through something similar or can recommend any specific types of therapy I should explore. 

I (27F) come from a ‚Äúbroken‚Äù home. My mother is very mentally ill and unmedicated and will not go to therapy. My father has abandoned his children in pursuit of making my mother happy (constantly putting her and her needs before the children). I raised my sister (who is 10 years younger), and she lived with me in my apartment throughout my college years. After 28 years of marriage, my father finally decided he needed to move on and my parents got divorced after being separated for the past year. I can share more details if necessary, but the bottom line is that I do not have any security around my immediate family besides my relationships with my 17 year old sister and grandmother. I do not rely on my parents for comfort, financial support, love, etc., and really only keep them in my life because I feel obligated to have relationships with them (I am working on this in therapy).

In my own relationship, my boyfriend (28m) comes from a very stable family. They have their ups and downs, but generally speaking, they are a very ‚Äútraditional nuclear‚Äù family. He has never judged me for my family issues, and he often reassures me that I somehow beat the odds and ended up with a good head on my shoulders despite the circumstances of my upbringing. 

Now here‚Äôs my issue: I feel like I am desperately seeking a ‚Äúfamily.‚Äù I feel like I need that more than anything else. It is my goal. To have a family that supports me and loves me. I feel naive, because I know a lot (if not most) of families have issues, but I am so stuck on this, and to be honest, it‚Äôs to my detriment. Earlier this week, while talking to my boyfriend, he mentioned how his definition of family is pretty traditional, and that he doesn‚Äôt see me as family until we are married or engaged. This felt like a gunshot to the heart, as I have worked really hard to build my ‚Äúchosen family,‚Äù full of close best friends and my boyfriend. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt worthy of his acceptance yet, or that I needed to have a ring on my finger to be his family. He has assured me that he is committed to me and loves me, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôll never be accepted, and it makes me doubt my relationship with him, and question my friendships. This entire conversation has caused me to do a lot of thinking about how I exist in my romantic relationship (and I‚Äôm sure it bleeds into my friendships). I have really high expectations of what I expect when I love someone. I expect them to become my ‚Äúhome,‚Äù and I did this in my last relationship. Do I project my definition of what I need in a family onto my boyfriend and friends? Do I expect more from others who may not be able to give that because I am lacking that in my own life? How do I find that in myself without feeling like I need a family?

This is really affecting my relationship, as I feel a deep concern about him not committing to me or abandoning me. I have read a lot about anxious attachment, but is there any other resources or forms of therapy that could be helpful? I am looking for things specifically to address family systems and how to build security in my own life without relying on others. Sorry if this is all over the place, but thank you for reading!!

1g1xy3s,Wholesome words from my therapist about my broken heart,therapy,1728732022.0,10,86,"I (29M) have been seeking support from a psychologist for 2 months since I discovered that my ex partner was cheating on me for 7 months. I was deeply in love with her (27F), I have found a good and well paid job so that we could grow together and have our own house. But she was sleeping with an other guy while I was at work, or worse... she even slept with the guy when I was attending my uncle's funeral. It destroyed me, and living through hell is an understatement...
I have been ranting about what she did to me and how she obliterated my mental health, my self esteem and my happiness...

My psychologist helped me a lot as I felt a lot of shame, guilt, anger and humiliation. She kept repeating that it wasnt my fault, I didnt deserve this much pain and its unfortunately a selfish choice she made...

Today she said something very sweet, and it kinda felt like a warm hug. She said ""Im starting to know you, and I can say one thing about you. You have a pure loving heart, its very precious and rare now these days... it was broken by someone who couldnt care for it... but once you are healed, imagine what'll be like once that heart is deeply appreciated and valued.

1javs7x,Broken up and hating myself,therapy,1741926485.0,0,3,"27F , boyfriend of 4 years broke up with me and wanted to be just friends, as healthy as the conversation was, I‚Äôm heartbroken because he said he tried his best but he don‚Äôt have the romantic feelings anymore because he is too hurt by what I did he can‚Äôt get past it even though he tried his hardest so now it‚Äôs time we break up. 
So last year during his one of the important exams when I was having the most difficult time of my life he asked me for some space because he is overwhelmed with everything, the space he was talking about was for 2 months, for me since I was not in good state myself and was begging him to visit me and wanting space part to me felt like he is pushing me away so I‚Äôll give him all the space he wants from me and the rush of emotions led me to breakup with him, which was heartbreaking for both of us, that hurt him so much. We still talked and I still asked him to visit him later since all I wanted was to love and be loved but this breakup which was clearly a huge mistake from my part, I could have been more patient and not made it about myself and not been needy and controlled my feelings a little. 8 months later we patched up after he said I‚Äôll give it another chance when I asked for forgiveness. This time we stayed for 4 months where I saw myself begging for the same love he used to give me, the same care and attention he used to give me. I remember crying a lot and I confessed to him that you seem changed and I see myself begging for your attention, to that he said he don‚Äôt feel the same and he‚Äôs trying his hardest but he can‚Äôt forgive and give me same love. That broke me and I told him he didn‚Äôt give me a clear chance then and that he was closed off. I told me that I realise that it was my fault and what I did was a huge mistake on me part and I take full accountability of my actions and that I beg him to forgive him and give me an open chance and that I miss him and that I should have been patient and I‚Äôm gonna do that 
To that he said he‚Äôs at fault because he can‚Äôt bring himself to get past the hurt but he wants  us to stay friends and he wants me to share if something‚Äôs wrong in my life( I have been having hard time since last year and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been begging him to visit me ) and he‚Äôs still there for me. 
He sees me as a friend now not more than that and he‚Äôs fine with that but me I still feel deeply for him and I still want another chance and staying just friends is right now very difficult for me and I feel heart broken and having a tough time still at work and in life I‚Äôve been having since our last breakup, I‚Äôm still in the same situation and I am still needy and lonely I was when I broke up last year but I‚Äôm trying to work on everything slowly. I can‚Äôt share my problems like he wants me to because I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm forgiven and that I‚Äôm enough for his love and attention to share my problems with him. 
Sorry for the long post, i am currently blaming myself for ruining a perfect relationship, I am lonely and started therapy (which I‚Äôm not regular with because I feel exhausted). 
Is there anybody in the same boat ?

I know that I've got it quite a lot better than most people, but honestly that makes me feel far worse. I've sought therapy multiple times, and every time it's thrown back at me for one reason or another. The mental healthcare system seems to be set up explicitly to avoid having to actually fix anybody's issues, likely because it would cost too much. I am certain that CBT will just patch up the holes in the bottle, but I need a deep clean. I need something that goes all the way into my soul with compassion and shows me first-hand the various ways in which the world isn't a horrible careless hole, devoid of true connection.

1fil3u4,I'm 16 and I'm at my wits end ,therapy,1726533640.0,6,2,"I'm not sure quite how to format this or if this is even the right sub to post this 

I have no where else to turn to that I trust, this is it. 

I'm gonna go straight into it becuase I don't wonna make this longer with introduction paragraphs. I am a Turbelent ISTP, my inferior function is Fe, and I'm pretty confident my attachment style is Disorganized or Fearful/Avoidant. If you think I'm exaggerating for attention you would be wrong,  I truly think I have that bad combination. 

Now for the wits end part, I've have been minimizing my problems becuase I knew others had it worse for years now, but recently I learned not to do that because my problems can still be big even if others are bigger,  and my daily struggles are chaotic, delicate, and they have high bars if I want to make the situations as good as possible but the way I've come to see it the most important emotional goals to me are extremely hard to acquire and maintain.

My parents divorced 7 years ago which led to me dealing with pretty severe anxiety everytime I would go to my mom's for a year and a half straight, it matured me and made me more emotionally intelligent and mature (I was still purty stupid I was 11 lol). But I had a kinda advanced understanding and outlook on everything I feel like.

The time where my life got harder and I was forced to grow up even more was 7th grade, I made 2 friends whom I enjoyed being around but they grew to be exact opposites and quite literally were in every way, so I would constantly have to juggle time, not offend the other, be a referee between them, the only reason they were around eachother is to hang out with me. It sucked butt, during that whole school year I was chasing this girl who I thought was the one, everything about them was perfect (I am self aware how I sound rn but I was like 12-13). After bothering my first crush for another semester I was completely traumatized to hear they were lesbian, like it quite literally shattered my world, so began my infernal lust for the comforting warmth in a relationship

By the way I'm telling my life story so you can get an idea about my psyche so I can be truly helped
Bear with me here.

2 years ago 1st year of high-school I got bolder and decided to get a girlfriend probably soulmate, I needed to push myself way out of my comfort zone and climb up the social ladder because I thought going that would make me more attractive and expand the buffet of hot chicks.

Oh yeah during this time my mom made my little half brother about 4 years ago, so I'll talk about him later.


Now finally to why I'm at my wits end

I cut ties with the bad vest friend who was at war with the other, I'm at the place I want to be on the social ladder, the only social thing I need to work out is becoming funny to all then I'm golden, I just need to focus on my grades and humor right?

I left out all the stressors, here is the main entree of screwed up.

My mom and her bf's kid Ryan who is my little brother gets emotionally and attentionly neglected most of the time and I don't want him to be neglected, my mom works alot of extra and she got pretty comfy with leaving Ryan to watch TV while she watches TV in the next room (she did the same with me but the difference is I had my Dad who cared about me) then is there is the boyfriend who is a good guy but also not, crappy father who doesn't really show that he cares about his kids, usually when Ryan calls dad he ignores him and looks at his phone; he's also a truck driver so he is only here on the weekends.
I feel like it's on me for my little brothers whole life not to be shadowed by early developmental neglect (and it's not all the time they do spend time with him but by actions he is not their top priority) He feels more secure with me and my dad becuase we play with him. My mom is a good person btw, she may be the way she is becuase of a tragic past, all in all her life hasn't been great.

I feel responsible for my dad's happiness because  he has had a sad kind of life, my mom was married to him for 13 years but the true marriage ended long before that, back then she said horrible things to him, cheated on him numerous times, and used him to get through her medschool. My poor dad. I'm the only constant happy thing in his life but I won't be here forever and he will be completely alone only having his friends to play viable with but that's still depressing, dreadfully depressing like unimaginable. I know I shouldn't be responsible and it's his choice to stay alone becuase of severe trauma but what other way can I put it, what I do determines my dad's happiness in life when I'm there; therefore makes me responsible for his happiness.

School life is the worst life, this can be viewed as subjective. Trying to get into a relationship with a girl in this generation is the hardest it's ever been in a long time, especially so for quiet people. I've been told I need to wait till college or something and when they explained it I saw their perspective and agreed but I should still try so I have a will to go on and the drive to do so. My point is that it's unimaginably disheartening and depressing to know how much I messed up, I started social life in mid middleschool but i didn't start doing it right till last year, so I have 0 foundation and I'm learning everything starting this year. At face value that's harmless but in reality I have to work harder than everyone else to fit in, learn social cues and how to harness the funny at a fast steady pace so I don't lose interest and lose what I've worked hard for, I want to make the most of high-school and grow as much as a person as I can from it, while also setting the foundation for my whole livelihood, but becuase of my disorganized attachment style, inferior function (fe) and my personality hindrances I'm a representation of Sisyphus. Meeting everyone's standards, learning hard subjects/dealing with junior life changing school stuff, trying to improve all the problems in my life is super freaking mentally exhausting and I don't know how to go forward.

I'm becoming irritable, I'm depressed, my soul is exhausted, I'm mentally exhuasted, I need to keep going but life tripped me over early, beat me as I got up, and shot all four of my limbs while I was running. 

Ofc when I'm typing this my mind goes blank and it sesms easy but that'll change tommorow, in reality I'm a 16 year old with 16 year old problems but amped up with difficulty and hinderances + plus other delicate life altering problems that seem to rest in my hands aswell, I'm always getting pulled in more than one direction. 
At this point I'm just ranting,

Last thing I'll say if you read this entire Lord of the Rings ahh script then you are a special person, one of a kind level of kindness that should be admired by everyone, you are special for reading this.

All of these problems have exhausted me and made me depressed as heck. What do you suggest I do, what can I work on, and please show empathy. Empathy and care is rare nowadays and most teens are empathy deficient.

vaeqqt,I am at the very tip of my wit's end.,therapy,1655010143.0,0,1,"I have so little energy left in my body to do anything but fucking cry and I don't have any more tears left.

I left a job at the beginning of the year that was devastating to my mental health, which is already pretty fucked as it is. I was physically dreading going to work. The expectations continued to grow for me, but the work was never sufficient. Leaving that job, to focus on the career I wanted to, was the intention, but absolutely came with sacrifice. I haven't had health insurance since the end of 2021, which hasn't been ideal.

I went to a job that I was familiar with, enjoyed doing, and excelled at. A new opportunity presented itself doing something similar for more money, so I jumped on it. Still no insurance, but more money, more growth opportunity, better product, etc.

Shit went south FAST. I was told ""allegations were made"" and sent home. Received zero communication for two weeks and was just removed from the schedule. That was it.

Scrambled to find a new job, found one as a server/bartender, which has been good, but not all that I need it to be financially.

I'm BROKE. Broker than I've ever been in my life, than I ever dreamed could be possible. So broke I'm scared.

I'm not eating regularly because I can't afford to go grocery shopping, so I'm rationing box meals; stretching Hamburger Helper for three days at a time.

I'm stretching tips for weeks at a time, scrounging change together to pay for gas to get me to my next shift where I can earn some more tip money to get me home.

I've applied for SNAP benefits, but have to prove income, which means having to reach out to three different employers for pay stubs--one of which won't respond to my requests at all.

I've applied for Medicaid, but have to prove my disability, which isn't necessarily possible, because my disability--Bipolar Disorder--hasn't caused me to miss work for any extended period of time.

I need regular therapy, but can't afford it without health insurance, so when I do have enough for a session, it fucking ROCKS me to the point where I can't get to work because I'm so emotionally fucking wrought that I can't stop crying long enough to get there.

I'm constantly hungry, perpetually tired, hurting people I love and care about unintentionally because my defense mechanisms are manifesting through snarky comments and dependency at other's expense. I've been trying to be better, more deliberate about getting natural light; exercising more; working on my own stuff. And yet I can't seem to catch a goddamn break.

I need two new tires on my car, one is leaking, the other is a spare I've been driving on for three days, but can't afford them both AND my prescriptions that are not only helping with my mental illness, but also compensating for my absent thyroid.

My dog continues to provide me solace, thank goodness, but can't go without feeding him, so $20 covers his bag of food, but that's also taking away from gas/grocery/therapy/maintenance/rent/utility money.

I don't have anything left in me. My spoons are gone. GONE.

I have been trying to find therapy through private insurance for two months now. But I just cant. I've searched through my insurances list of providers. Every single one I talk to tells me

""Oh I dont accept insurance anymore"".

I got back to my insurance and they keep telling me that they should and dont know what the problem is. 

20 minutes ago I got another call back from a therapist. They told me that ""no therapist will soon take insurance because the companies wont raise their rates"". She then proceeded to try and sell me on her current rate of 150 dollars per session. Which I cant even come close to affording, especially on top of the fucking ludicrous amount I already pay per months for my apparently useless insurance plan. 

Im so beyond done with this entire process. And that last call just fucking eradicated any last hope I had to find something. 

Does anyone have any advice or know of something I can do?

b19hmy,I'm at my wits end and can't express my negative emotions,therapy,1552618006.0,2,1,"Hello r/therapy hivemind. I have not been able to see an actual therapist for several months and I'm struggling big time today. I'm usually able to bottle up my emotions and ignore them (yes, I know, bad u/doomofraven!), but today I'm having a very hard time doing just that.

&#x200B;

I'm currently in a situation I'd rather not be. My mother has Stage IV Lung Cancer and we are at a world renowned hospital for a clinical trial to see if we can stop the spread/growth of the cancer itself, basically putting her in to remission. That sounds great, right? Well, it would be great if my mother wasn't emotionally abusive. I moved out a few years ago, fed up with her abuse at last, and here I am again, back in the deep of it.

&#x200B;

I wouldn't want to be anywhere else, don't get me wrong. Despite my mom's faults, I love her to death. I don't even think she realizes how hurtful some of the things she says are sometimes. But she displays a lot of the traits of your typical emotional abuser, gaslighting, back handed compliments, etc. 

&#x200B;

What my point is, today, is I've been told to bottle up my negative emotions from the time I was very young, when crying when I wasn't feeling well was ""no longer acceptable"". I no longer know how to express negative emotions without violently crying or screaming and yelling in anger. Those are my two outlets. I need some help here. What sort of thing can I do to express these emotions without ripping my mom's head off?

1inmfoz,New therapist is frustrating me,therapy,1739348981.0,11,6,"Recently began coaching sessions with a mental health/well-being coach.

We went over what skills I currently use and covered some skills that I can try out in my own time.

Throughout the conversation I felt the therapist was battling me. 

I would say ‚Äòoh I use this skill which was previously taught to me by a psychotherapist and I‚Äôve found it helpful for xyz‚Äô and then the therapist would pick at my comment to find flaws in what I had said even though it was a perfectly reasonable comment and logically sound. (E.g. When my heart beats fast and I‚Äôm anxious after having being triggered then I find it helpful to simply mindfully notice the ‚Äòheart beating fast sensation‚Äô whilst recognising I as the self can witness it and don‚Äôt have to act on compulsions and urges that arise, I am able to recognise space between the sensations and ‚ÄòI‚Äô, I can simply notice I am safe and I‚Äôve just been triggered and then take steps to ground and soothe myself‚Ä¶ But according to the therapist this is ‚Äòwrong‚Äô‚Ä¶)

The end result was that I kept getting shut down and felt I was being suppressed (which I was because they would ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô me and or ignore what I had said). 

I felt I was constantly being one upped and diminished. 

At one point during the session, the therapist‚Äôs face turned hostile and their face began to twitch, it appeared to me that there was a lot of anger underneath the surface. Nothing I said is obvious to me to have been hurtful etc so I‚Äôm unsure why they displayed that behaviour. I actually left a little concerned. 

How can I tell the therapist to chill out and backoff without being aggressive? I get the impression that the therapist isn‚Äôt going to listen as they weren‚Äôt listening to me or rather choosing to selectively ignore.

1jj9b3v,At a crossroad.,therapy,1742870256.0,2,4,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. We've been married for 22 years, together for a lot longer than that with three kids, two in high school and one in college.

 I got a text from the sheriff's department asking me to call them and then a flood of texts from the neighbors asking me what was going on.  I knew my daughter was at home alone and feared the worst.  I spoke with the sheriff, and he said they were taking her to the emergency room, and I immediately left a meeting and met her there.  My wife was in-flight on her way to visit my mother-in-law, oldest daughter, and her sister who traveled out there with her.  She received the same texts from the neighbors and was frantic so I tried to keep her updated as best I could on the way to the ED.  After a long wait I was able to see her and thankfully she was fine physically but was referred to an inpatient mental health facility. 
 
I agreed and headed that way to fill out paperwork and get her checked in.  My wife wanted to fly back but I told her to stay out there as it was important to spend time with everybody (her Mom has serious health issues), that visiting hours were limited, and that I would take care of things at home.
I visited my daughter at every opportunity at the facility, dealt with the billing, paperwork, appointments and everything else while keeping my wife updated several times daily.  I reached out to my daughter‚Äôs boss, school, and her performance group to let them know she was hospitalized and keep them updated.

My wife was unsure about staying out there, but I assured her I had things under control and to spend quality time with the rest of the family, but I did warn her I would need time to decompress once she got back.
I adjusted my work schedule so I could drop off and pick up my son every day and spend as much time as possible with him between doctors‚Äô appointments, visits with my daughter, and work.   We cooked dinners together, watched movies, and cleaned up the house so my wife and daughter would come home to comfort.

After about a week my daughter was discharged, and I brought her home.  My wife was flying back that night, so I got her car washed as she mentioned it being particularly dirty before she left.  We all went to pick her up at the airport and had an emotional reunion.  
We set up appointments for family and individual therapy and while there is still a long journey ahead, my daughter is headed in the right direction.  
I was supposed to go out of town for a boys‚Äô weekend at a lake and while I felt it would be good for my mental health; I felt it best to stay home and spend time together as a family.  

Saturday morning, I woke up early to feed and let out the dog and noticed that she had gotten into the trash and spread it throughout the first floor of the house.  I cleaned it up, laid down on the couch to watch TV and dozed off.  I woke to my wife asking me if my son and I had spoken about quitting Muay Thai as we had missed it, it was expensive, and he had expressed to her he didn‚Äôt want to go any more (keep in mind we started going together at his request).  I was mildly annoyed as there was no hello or good morning, just pointed questions, but we agreed to cancel it going forward and I let it go.
Later we were all hanging out in the family room and she mentioned she had been looking at new light fixtures for the house.  I expressed surprise because we had been discussing getting a new dining room set and asked ‚ÄúI thought you wanted a new dining room set?‚Äù.  She said she wanted the dining set, the lights and a lot more.  For background, I handle our long-term finances, and she handles the short-term.  We have been discussing home upgrades for some time, but she felt we couldn‚Äôt afford them.  I told her let‚Äôs make a list and prioritize them.  I chose a new cooktop and hood as ours wasn‚Äôt working correctly which aggravated me daily as I do most of the cooking.  She wanted a new dining room set.  She didn‚Äôt think we could afford both and I told her we could tap into long term funds whether that was via loans or selling stock.  I moved forward on the cooktop and she was going to pick out and order the dining room set.  She wasn‚Äôt convinced we could afford what she wanted and pointed out that I was going on a snowboard trip that I had been planning for a year.  I told her I would skip the trip if that made her more comfortable ordering the dining room set she wanted.  I was willing to sacrifice something important to me for something important to her, so when she mentioned the lights and more I was thrown off because I had sacrificed something important to me and the dining room set didn‚Äôt seem important to her anymore, and I didn‚Äôt understand.  We discussed it further and while I didn‚Äôt raise my voice I am sure my aggravation and surprise came through.  She burst into tears and went upstairs.

She stayed in our room the rest of the day except for coming down briefly for dinner.  I tried to engage with her but she didn‚Äôt seem interested.  Later a neighbor invited us over to their house for drinks and board games but when I asked if she wanted to go she declined.  I ended up falling asleep early on the couch.  The next morning I received the following text ‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving for a little bit.  When I get back I think we need to have a discussion about our future.  This isn‚Äôt it‚Äù.

I immediately went to speak with her and she told me that she didn‚Äôt feel I support her and implied we should end things.  I told her my side of the story and then left to go for a drive to clear my head.  

I am not perfect by any means and have many things I could handle better, but I am a good father and husband.  I love my wife but feel like I am at my wit‚Äôs end.  I could not have been more supportive for everybody in my family during one of the worst periods in our lives and then to be told I am not being supportive and threatened with divorce is heartbreaking.  I told her I need time to decompress but felt attacked and then no concern for my feelings.

I know everyone is under stress and I am trying to give grace, but I need support, too.  The last time I needed support was when I was caring for my Mom full-time through a divorce complicated by dementia, which eventually led to an ALS diagnosis and eventually her passing all in the middle of Covid.  During this time my wife was cold, distant, and said ‚Äúshe needed some space‚Äù.  The two times that I truly needed support in our marriage not only did I not get it, but it felt like a heavier burden was placed on me.

We work well together as parents and have built a good life for ourselves financially, but I‚Äôve felt for some time that I am putting more effort into us than she is.  Our plan was for the kids to graduate high school, we would retire early, and travel the world, but it‚Äôs tough to see now.

We‚Äôve tried marriage counseling in the past and while I saw value in it, she didn‚Äôt and the last time I brought it up she said, ‚Äúthe counselor looked at me like I was crazy and that‚Äôs probably what you wanted‚Äù.  After a moment of stunned silence, I told her ‚Äúno, I want you to be happy, I want us to be happy‚Äù.

My plan is to continue to focus on my daughter and the other kids to get us through this crisis but put less effort into the relationship.  I‚Äôve come to the realization I can‚Äôt make her happy if she doesn‚Äôt put an effort into making herself happy.  While I hope for her and the kids‚Äô sake she finds happiness, I suspect once I am removed from the situation, she‚Äôll still be unhappy and realize what could‚Äôve been.  It sucks that I can‚Äôt retire soon as planned and will have to start over again.  All I know is I can‚Äôt do this anymore.

We plan to continue family counseling, and I am considering individual counseling again despite my last counselor ghosting me.  I suspect it was because on the surface I would appear self-aware but I still felt value in expressing my feelings.  Apparently my wife could hear my conversations from the level below and said I wasn‚Äôt opening up to him. I didn‚Äôt find that out until after the fact, not sure how I feel about that.   Anyway, not sure if I am asking for advice or just trying to get it off my chest at this point.

In my last session, my therapist mentioned that, early on, he had a ‚Äúsense‚Äù that my sexuality was ‚Äúdifferent.‚Äù That phrasing didn‚Äôt sit right with me‚Äîit felt heteronormative, like I was being perceived through a lens of ‚Äúotherness.‚Äù When I told him it made me feel like a ‚Äúwalking stereotype,‚Äù he said he wasn‚Äôt talking about stereotypes. Later, he clarified his wording, but the moment still left me uneasy.

Then, he pointed out that I might also hold stereotypes about non-queer people‚Äîmaybe even about him. That shift in the conversation made me feel like my emotions weren‚Äôt fully acknowledged, and I left feeling like something was unresolved.

At the same time, by the end of the session, he told me he admired me for coming out to him and that it was an honor for him to witness my journey. That really moved me.im now overwhelmed cause I love my therapist and I don‚Äôt want our therapeutic relationship to erode

I have a full time job. I have a social life including being involved in my community. I have hobbies I actively make time for. I try and make time to do breath work / nervous system regulation. I attend therapy. I am not on medication currently but have been in the past.

Every weekend (and sometimes during the week also) I have a panic attack / breakdown. I start crying and then screaming and shaking and convulsing. I then start harming myself by clawing, scraping, hitting, throwing myself into the wall. If my partner is around and tries to help, I end up shouting at them / picking a fight. It takes me hours to calm down and when I do I feel immense guilt and feel compelled to apologise over and over to my partner (if they were there to witness it) and punish myself through self harm, withholding food etc. I feel like such a horrible person and so out of control. These panic attacks are getting worse and worse and I‚Äôm really starting to fear them. I‚Äôm trying my best to regulate / meet myself with kindness but I feel such overwhelming self hatred for the way I act in these ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù that it feels near impossible to meet myself with kindness. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm just fundamentally a horrible person (judging by my actions) and I should be locked up in jail or something.

I lost my best friend because she and I were pressured to date and it inevitably burned quickly, but after it ended, she told me that everything that had happened in the relationship was essentially a lie; every ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù every dance, every little bit of affection was an act because she was too scared to talk to me about it. 
As a result of that, we don‚Äôt even talk anymore and even after a few months I haven‚Äôt gotten over her at all, and if anything I‚Äôve just gotten worse. We still see each other daily and we‚Äôre still in the same friend group, we just never willingly talk or even look at each other anymore, which feels so depressing based off how we hit it off as soon as we met. 
In addition to that, my family isn‚Äôt necessarily the best, making me have to find work arounds to not think about anything.

1inltc0,Active Duty Military seeing Telehealth?,therapy,1739346245.0,0,1,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm really hoping my post reaches the right people who can share their experiences with this type of clientele/situation and possibly provide anyyy kind of resource (e.g specific links, websites, ect) that can help point us in the right direction. At this point, we‚Äôre feeling completely helpless, hopeless, and lost with the amount of research we‚Äôve already tried doing with the BBS, military posts, and the regular web with our questions so pleaseee, any insight would be greatly appreciated.

For context, my partner and I are doing individuals and couples therapy but specifically, with CSAT therapists, which have been incredibly hard to find with our situation and its complex layers and are lucky to have even found the ones we‚Äôre currently seeing. Unfortunately, my partner now has military orders and will be deployed soon for quite some time, and we just barely started our sessions about a month ago. We are at our wits end of researching trying to figure out where to get the concrete ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù on whether he can continue seeing his therapist and our couples through Zoom while he‚Äôs deployed overseas, because one CSAT we met prior (but wasn‚Äôt the best fit) said she could see him after he deploys without a problem but the one he‚Äôs currently seeing just told him that he ‚Äúasked around‚Äù and it doesn‚Äôt look like he can after all. I find that really hard to believe considering what that previous CSAT said, the fact that he‚Äôs not relocating and his residence will still be CA, AND I had a friend who was in the military but stationed outside the US and continued to see her CA therapist via Telehealth. We also made sure to ask this specific question to the CSATs we found and most didn‚Äôt know the answer because military itself is tricky and they never had clients in that situation while some said it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. I‚Äôve even seen my therapist while I was out of the country for vacation, so as you can see, we‚Äôre very confused and highly concerned.

We understand that there could be jurisdictions and laws in the country he‚Äôs going to, but that was a lost cause when we tried researching all that and just came back to us trying to find something about Telehealth and active duty military. We also know that the military provides their own resources for therapy, but again, our situation is complex and we need to be paired with a CSAT amongst other things so he cannot just see anyone, and from what we‚Äôve found so far, is that theyre definitely not going to provide CSATs or anything with the level of expertise/care he needs. From what we found googling through the BBS website and their 300+ documents, it had nothing with seeing clients in this exact situation either and it doesn‚Äôt look like I can send them an email without having a license myself but we are trying to put in the work too. If I can provide SOME sort of resource or contact info to these therapists (even though I know it should be on them to look into this as well) maybe it might just be enough for them to get the concrete yes or no from the local board, main board, whatever board they‚Äôd need to feel more comfortable with seeing active duty military? I just cannot accept an ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, never dealt with that‚Äù or ‚Äúmy buddies didn‚Äôt have any answers so it looks like it‚Äôs a no‚Äù without giving all my effort in trying to find an actual REAL answer. 

It‚Äôs a large world we just don‚Äôt know about and we cannot afford to lose our CSATs while he‚Äôs deployed, so again, we‚Äôre just asking for simple direction on where to go or who to ask or what the process is when it comes to this very specific situation.

She's at her wits end and there are no other family or friends they can call on for support. 

He and I have talked alot about our challenges and therapy (he's never tried it, has a lot of stigma ideas). I am usually someone he trusts and can calm him.

I am constantly putting myself under the pressure  of something or the other being horribly wrong. I am just not able to come to terms with life will not always be easy. Every big or small problem feels like the universe is conspiring against me. This leads to feel lonely and very needy for any sort validation. Sometimes, I feel that the problem is me and sometimes I feel the universe does not like me. But I'm 100% of the times sad and the sadness has really begun to affect by day to day. 

Can someone guide me here?

I have tried speaking to 4 therapists, but none of them last too long with me for different reasons.

For context, I workout everyday, eat healthy, don't have any addictions, make decent money, have a loving wife, all boxes ticked basically! üßø",lonely

1gih7hw,I‚Äôve been so lonely for such a long time and I just don‚Äôt know how to get out of the cycle. ,therapy,1730617120.0,1,3,"I‚Äôm bipolar. And in my early 20‚Äôs my symptoms really spiraled out of control for a long time. Covid did absolutely nothing to help that situation and it recently hit me how little I‚Äôve accomplished in my life. I‚Äôm self employed and barely make enough to cover my basic needs because I simply cannot work a regular schedule due to my periodic depressive and manic cycles. I work online, editing audio and video for things like podcasts or short YouTube videos. I haven‚Äôt held steady employment in a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù since I was in my sophomore year of college. I dropped out of college in my junior year because of complications surrounding covid and I simply was never able to make myself go back. 

Now I‚Äôm 25 and about to be 26 in the next month. I live with my mother because I simply don‚Äôt make enough money to be able to afford anything else. And also because quite frankly she‚Äôs in poor health and in many ways I feel an obligation to be there for her because of all the help she‚Äôs given me over the years and all the financial help she still gives me. At this point though I feel like I‚Äôm using her health as an excuse to not better myself. 

I‚Äôve never been in a real relationship that‚Äôs lasted more than a couple weeks. Either I get too attached too quickly and push them away or they decide I‚Äôm too much of a mess to be in a relationship with, which I frankly can‚Äôt blame them for. After all how could someone love me if I can‚Äôt even love myself. How can I be deserving of someone‚Äôs love if I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm deserving of my own love? 

I look at my friends and save for one of them who‚Äôs just as screwed up as me they all seem to be so much further in life than I am. Two are married, one is engaged and has a kid, another is in a long term relationship that frankly is going to become an engagement soon, and the last is working at a aerospace manufacturer after getting out of the military. I‚Äôm happy for all of them, and none of them have ever said anything to make me feel less than them. But I do feel less than them. How can I not? They have everything I want and more. They have loving partners, good paying jobs, a couple of them even own rather nice houses. I look at their lives and I see what I wish I was, and what I feel like I never can be. 

Worse than all of that though is the feeling that I‚Äôm becoming irrelevant. My friends don‚Äôt need me anymore, and the further they progress with their own lives the less time they have to spend with me. Meanwhile I have nothing but time. Time to sit and think about all the things I‚Äôve done wrong. My mother still needs me for now and in some ways more than ever, but with her declining health how long can I expect that to last? And when she‚Äôs gone what will I be? Not a caregiver, not a successful career man, not a husband or even a boyfriend. What will I be but a sad lonely man with no purpose who can‚Äôt even take care of himself. ",lonely
1fo1i8f,My social skills have been declining and have been feeling very lonely,therapy,1727142978.0,1,3,"I just have no idea what happened to me this year. I decided to be super locked in at school this year, because where I go this is the year that you can get many opportunities, but I don't think me being more focused on my studies is the reason.

I have lost like 90% of my social skills, words simply won't come out of my mouth, and I have noticed that some people have become a bit distant.

Last year I had a friend that I talked to and hanged out with quite a lot, but after the vacations he just doesn't talk to me anymore. There is another guy that I have been friends with since first grade, and he invited me to go with him on a trip on the summer break. After that trip, he also hasn't talked to me, like he doesn't even greet me most of the time. I have had 0 close friends these days. There's no one I truly trust, not even people I have known for years. Last year I felt like I belonged somewhere, now I just feel like I am a stranger in any group. Nobody really cares about me, I just exist. I have kind of gotten used to being lonely, but its just really boring and I still got 2 years of school to go, so Im not sure if I want to spend my last 2 years of school getting bored to death.

I have never been very social, I am an introvert, but this year has just felt like trash. I am sure that it's something on my end that is causing this but I am not sure what exactly is it. I have been invited to go out to parties or hang out sometimes and have refused most of the time because I just did not feel like going out, or was just scared to go interact with people and made some dumb excuse up (minor thing but I have been having social anxiety lately). When I try to talk to someone, I just freeze for some reason. I want to say stuff but just cannot get it out. It has even crossed my mind that maybe I am just imagining all of this (I have been an overthinker my entire life) and I am the one that is isolating myself from my friends. But I just don't know what to do.

I have no older sibling of my own to turn to when I need advice or when I need someone to talk to. I have always had to figure things out on my own.

Some 2 years ago, one dog of mine died of... Everything xd, sorry for making this pun, she just had almost everyhing a old dog could had, i felt the same angst, this time about now knowing what to do, i kept running around the same waya when my grandma died, but this time i did not cry

Yesterday, my other dog also died, now because of complications with his bladder, but he died without pain, sedated in a clinic, i just got informed when i came back from school, this time i just felt ""oh... Ok"", i was neutral

Today, my mom freed her bird for it to roam free and my grandma's cat got it, my mom was in crumbles, i, again, felt angst about not knowing how to handle that, how to confort my mom

These things happen, there is nothing i could have done to prevent it, there is no fixing death"", i do not understand why i handle sadness this way, i feel that this is not a healthy way

1j0ljmm,Living with my roomates brings me rage and sadness,therapy,1740785423.0,2,1,"Short version: I hate my roomates, don't feel good at my apartment and have nightmares at night. Advice needed, question down below.

Long version:
I am 21f, living first time outside of my parents house in an all female apartment. I live in an apartment for people who cope with mental health issues (so am I). I have lived there for 6 months.

I have three roomates: S, R and J.
S has been in the apartment the longest (2 years), then R (1.5 years), lastly J (1 year).
S and R are very good friends. J is introverted and spends most of the time alone.

In the beginning I was friends with R and bought food with her. At some point I realized I am losing money (she bought more with our money), so I decided to split. Then her view on me changed.

It started with untasteful jokes from R, passive aggressive remarks and overall bad attitude. Continued with her touching my stuff in the kitchen, and this week us yelling at each other after she said at our apartment gathering that my snoring at the living room interrupted her coffee making smh. Apparently it's against the rules to sleep in the living room.

In the beginning J, R and I cooked for each other. I am vegetarian so they didn't really put effort to make things for me, so I decided to stop cooking for everyone and just for myself. J&R cook now but also for S who stopped cooking for others. Doesn't  seem fair. 

This week aswell, S complained about the scent diffuser in my room, saying it spreads over the apartment and gives her dissociation. Can a scent give you dissociation? Do nice smells cause anxiety? Asking me to close the door all the time. 

Lastly, after I complained about J washing dishes loudly at midnight, that she stored for days at her room, she has decided that she doesn't want us to use her dishes anymore and now we need to bring plates, cups, silverware, bowls and more.

I don't sleep well there at all, usually sleeping well at my parents' house on the weekends. This week having awful nightmares. 

Am I just overreacting or is this just dreadful?
Should I move?
Is it worth it to put up with the constant fighting?

Whenever someone is sad around me, anywhere from slightly upset to bawling their eyes out, it feels disgustingly fake to me. I almost get mad in a sense. Very rarely do I ever feel some sort of sympathy or empathy towards someone who is upset. The few times it‚Äôs felt real is when I was sad as well. Or if something really big happened. This goes for people I know as well. Family and friends who cry around me just feel fake. As awful as it sounds I get annoyed by people being sad around me. I want to leave the room so bad when someone starts crying but I know that‚Äôs beyond rude. Why do I feel this way? How do I stop it?

1iqwmwy,Why do I get random episodes of sadness?,therapy,1739725091.0,2,1,"Since fall I‚Äôve been having such negative thoughts and self talk about myself, many rooting from my poor body image issues, and they‚Äôve only gotten worse as time went on.

Lately, I wanna say around December, my thoughts have turn into full on breakdowns. One negative thought about myself invited multiple, all getting worse as it went on. I could think something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so clumsy‚Äù and it would be followed by something like ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do anything right‚Äù and get progressively worse. I would end up snot-nosed and crying by the end of it.

Today I had another one of these episodes. I was getting dressed and caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. I remember thinking something about how my body shape and immediately I kept thinking I was ugly. As I kept looking, I kept getting thoughts like ‚ÄúYou should just die‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt deserve to eat‚Äù or thoughts of self harm. I haven‚Äôt thought anything like that in a while so I was obviously alarmed. It just turned into noise.

1j1goit,It makes me sad that so little of my life is actually within my control.,therapy,1740883180.0,0,1,"I‚Äôve been thinking about my life and reflecting on life in general lately. One thing I‚Äôve noticed is that I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm the creator of my life. I think the best way to sum up how I feel is this: I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm in the driver‚Äôs seat. I feel more like a passenger, and sometimes I don‚Äôt even feel like that. I feel like a passenger who is along for the ride, and when I feel worse than that, I feel like I‚Äôm more like a stranded pedestrian on the road that can‚Äôt go anywhere.

Due to some health problems I‚Äôve experienced over the past few years, I feel like I‚Äôve lost at least the last 3 years of my life.

The problem that‚Äôs most upsetting to me that relates to my body has been going on for 5 years now. I feel like I need answers, but I feel like I haven‚Äôt been able to get any answers as to what‚Äôs wrong with me. I feel pretty defeated by my life, to be honest.

I don‚Äôt know what someone is supposed to do when they feel like the last 5 or more years of their life have been lost. I wish I could change it, but I can‚Äôt. Many years I‚Äôll never get back are gone now, and I feel stuck in the present, like I‚Äôm trying harder than other people have to try to make less progress than other people make and at a slower speed. It‚Äôs discouraging.

I‚Äôve started thinking about how we actually have so little control over our lives and what happens to us in our lives. There are two things that made me think of us this.

The first thing is social acceptance. Humans are social beings naturally, but some of us are wired to have problems socially. I suspect I‚Äôm autistic. I think it‚Äôs sad how humans are born with a desire (some would say more than a even strong desire, but a ‚Äúneed‚Äù) to be socially accepted and belong, but some of us can‚Äôt experience this because of how we are. It‚Äôs sad that we have this desire but are unable to fulfill it. I feel like as people, we have next to no control over our social experiences. Because we can‚Äôt give ourselves acceptance from another person. It‚Äôs sad that we as humans are born with a need that some of us can never meet. It‚Äôs like a baby being born with lungs that need to breathe air, but being born unable to breathe.

The second thing has to do with bodies. Dealing with the physical pain I‚Äôve been in and how my body is has taken years of my life away from me. I know my life would‚Äôve been different for at least the past 5 years if I had had two things: a different body and better mental health, and one of the most important parts of me managing to somehow better my mental health is connected to me having a different body.

I have a chronic pain condition, depression, and I also have something else going on with my body that makes me feel poorly about it that I don‚Äôt want to describe a lot about in this post.

What I will say about it is this: So much of our life is determined or affected by if our bodies work. People will judge and mistreat someone just due to how their body is, even if whatever is wrong isn‚Äôt the person‚Äôs fault. Some of us have bodies that fight against us and cause us pain everyday, and I‚Äôm one of those people. I don‚Äôt know why my body has turned against me, but I‚Äôm exhausted and feel defeated from it.

The person in question who scares the daylights out of me is a woman who is the plant manager

I have been working there for 10 years. The first 2 years everybody treated me like family because it is a family owned coil shop where we make air conditioning coils

The coil shop doesn't have health insurance so we have to go through Healthcare marketplace to get our insurance

So there is no therapy that we can get unless we get it on our own. 

As I states. Two years into being with this family owned outfit I was treated like family. I was even welcomed during the interview. Have made mistakes while running fins but they were overlooked.  

Most of the supervisors are cousins. About two years into being on the job one of the cousins decided he didn't like me and even tried to call out my security by saying he saw me leaving a gay club in town which is bullying but no one did anything about it. Just laughed it off. I have not spoken to this person since

So around 2016 I had a car accident after leaving work in which a 15 year old boy ran out in front of my car and almost went through my windshield. Everybody at work laughed at me because I had to drive to work for a whole week with a busted windshield.  No one offered me emotional support for not bring injured.  That was the first red flag but I needed the money.

In 2018 my aunt died of ALS while I was at work 5 days before Christmas and they didn't let me take off work to go to the hospital before she took her last breath.  Again no one comforted me 

In 2019 my other two aunts were murdered while I was on the job on October 9th. They let me take off the week to plan their funerals because the murders made such big local headlines. But when I came back to work I didn't get a collection taken up or flowers for the family.  And I could hear some of them laughing behind my back when I broke down crying over my aunts. Even almost got fired for going into the bathroom so much to break down

2020 comes around. The covid hits. The plant shuts down. I'm laid off for a whole month and had to fight to make sure they send me my unemployment. I come back to work another ain't dies of Stage 4 and I still didn't get any emotional support and by this time they started accusing me of making up stuff just to take off work. Even was called stupid by my supervisor for wanting to take off for her funeral 

In 2021. I had a cousin die of Covid and an aunt die of Covid. I did not get any time off and had to force myself to be at work because again I needed the money because by that time I found out I owed the IRS $10,300 DOLLARS. OF Which I have managed to pay all of it back. 

Then In 2022 I had to take off work in the mornings to assist another family member while they completed treatment for stage 1 and by this time I knew the company didn't give a damn about me so I tried to keep it quiet but someone went and told the whole plant about it which again left me humiliated

In 2023 as a result of all the bullying and backstabbing and trauma I myself suffered an anxiety attack on April 27 In which I had to go to the hospital before work. As soon. As I came to work the plant manager told me to get MY HEAD OUT OF MY ASS in front of other co workers because I was moving too slow

And in 2024 my uncle died of pancreatic cancer suddenly before Thanksgiving. By this time I was traumatized beyond belief. Instead of offering me support the same plant manager again yelled at me in front of coworkers at the company Christmas function 

Isn't it understandable I don't want to go back to this toxic place when they open on Monday. But I don't have any other jobs lined up and who else is going to pay the bills?
I have posted an updated resume to indeed and linkd in. And glass door. Please hope for my mental sanity I will find another job before the holidays come back around

In the meantime what else can I do. I have sex with randoms to ease the load but what else can I do. I go work out

I don't know what else to do.  What would yall do?",panic attacks

I saw my grandmother who took care of me, pass away when I was 6 and my dad passed away this February, and my mom's getting old, her 70th birthday was on October. I get anxiety attacks because I fear my mom will pass away anytime now, but selfishly, I get them mostly because I know I will die eventually. 

My friend thinks its because of drugs(cocaine, weed sometimes, Adderall sometimes) and drinking causes me to feel this way. It would randomly just pop up out of nowhere, I was just watching a nfl highlight reel and it just pops up out of nowhere. Is there any mental or physical practices I can do when I get these attacks that will help? 

I used to take solace that reincarnation is possible, but then I realized that even if it is, I won't remember it. So ultimately it is my fear of losing my consciousness, my memories, that I fear the most. Thank you everyone for taking the time to read this. 

Happy holidays everyone.

1ivs7zh,Question on therapist!!,therapy,1740256094.0,1,2,"Hello

I wanted to post this to see what other peoples thoughts are on this. I‚Äôve been seeing my therapist since 2019. Overall, there have been benefits and I have seen improvement in my life. I went to see her due to Narcissistic Abuse from my family.

Now, it‚Äôs been over five years. I‚Äôve had this gut feeling for a while to change therapists, and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs right or if I‚Äôm overthinking it/expecting too much of her too fast. I‚Äôm starting to question if she‚Äôs just taking my money at this point/making me therapy dependent. Below are the reasons that lead me to feel this way.

- She opens every session with ‚Äúwell what do you want to talk about‚Äù. This isn‚Äôt inherently bad. I don‚Äôt have anyone else to talk to about my problems. Sure, I have friends, but I can‚Äôt constantly trauma dump on them. So this is nice to just tell someone everything and have them support me. However, sometimes I wonder what direction we are even going in. She doesn‚Äôt lead charge much, and I sometimes feel like she is just there is listen and validate me, which again isn‚Äôt the worst thing, but is this enough at this point?
- I‚Äôve shared to her many times that I think I have CPTSD. The first time I said this, she asked me what that was. I was kinda shocked. I felt like I knew more than her. I understand CPTSD isn‚Äôt the most widely recognized, but I also was kinda like‚Ä¶how do you not know what this is when you‚Äôre a therapist for narcissistic abuse survivors.
- I‚Äôve told her many times that I have intimacy issues. I‚Äôm in my upper twenties and I‚Äôve been chronically single my whole life. I think a big part as to why is my parents abusive marriage, how they treated me, and the overall larger family dynamics of lack of empathy, fakeness/toxic positivity, sweeping things under the rug, generational trauma, etc. 
- Every time I mention the above issue on intimacy issues, she asks me why do I think that is, as in why do I have intimacy issues. Or, she‚Äôll say something like ‚Äúwell what do we do about that!?‚Äù Sometimes I get frustrated and I feel like SHE as my counselor should be giving me more wisdom and advice and prompting. She is 40 years older than me! I get sometimes having the patient try and self evaluate, but it seems lackluster on her part.
- Whenever I‚Äôm struggling with sleep/insomnia issues, she‚Äôll just regurgitate the same basic notation to me in this sing-songy tone like ‚Äúohhhh nooooo you know that‚Äôs not good for you or your mental health.‚Äù Then she‚Äôll suggest mindfulness as if I don‚Äôt already know this. 
- I am having constant ruminations about the abuse from my parents/people that have triggered me in similar ways to them. I‚Äôve mentioned this to her before, and she listens but doesn‚Äôt offer much of a game plan. One time she even told me that all of this was ‚ÄúMe‚Äù. I told her I thought I was having these ruminations because I was mad at the people who abused me and she literally said ‚Äúit‚Äôs all you‚Äù. I couldn‚Äôt tell if she was trying to insinuate that the ruminations/anger were a result of like my ‚ÄúCritical Parent‚Äù in my head, or if this was kinda a messed up statement to make.
- She gets up and goes to the bathroom almost every session. She is older, likely upper 60‚Äôs, so idk if it‚Äôs some medial issue. But like legit every session she‚Äôll just stand up mid conversation and be like ‚Äúhold that thought, I have to go to the bathroom‚Äù. She‚Äôll then return like 3 min later and will apologize and then we continue talking.
- I had to ask her for homework one time. During our next session, she didn‚Äôt even really mention it and just opened with ‚Äúso what do you want to talk about‚Äù again.
- I was sexually harassed by a family member. This person ended up being arrested and went to jail for a separate person he was inappropriate with. When I was complaining to her one day about him being released from prison soon, she essentially said to me ‚Äúyou need to cut the ribbon from him and what the outcome of his situation is‚Äù. Like thanks‚Ä¶I guess. 
- She forgot my name one time and called me a similar sounding name to my own. Granted this was only one time over 3 years ago and it has not happened since, but still I remember it.

Good things about her:

- She is always prompt and on time 
- She is flexible with sessions, and is willing to work with you to meet. One time, she even had a crisis session with me back in 2020 last minute. 
- She validates me many times and tells me I am smart, confident, etc. Essentially positive affirmations. Tells me I am doing good in life.

1hlyi6s,Huge Anxiety Spike - What's Happening To Me?!,therapy,1735123241.0,7,1,"Hello,

I (18 Male) am a freshman in college and I just finished my first semester.

At the end of said semester, I had difficulties with my professor that led to me becoming anxious about the situation.

Over time, the anxiety grew larger. After the semester ended, I've been having to deal with more and more issues one after another. Usually, high-school me would've breezed through it and just hopped on my X-Box to play Sonic or something.

But now my anxiety is out of control. I'm vomiting and have diarrhea. I have no appetite and have lost so much weight to the point I need belts for pants that used to be tight on me, and even though I have no appetite I'm starving, but when I try to eat I end up going to the bathroom to vomit some more. I don't want to get out of bed anymore. I'm constantly seeking reassurance.

Like yeah sometimes we all just need some reassurance but here's the problem. I already got reassurance for everything. I know everything is going to be okay and everything is going to get resolved.

So why is my anxiety still just as bad? Ever since that mild difficulty with my professor, everything has been causing me stress. I'm constantly unsure about every single decision I make. I feel like I can't even spell my own name right anymore and have to check 100+ times even though I got it the first time. I'm not even talking to my friends anymore but I used to talk to them nonstop. Every second of my day is spent scrolling the Internet for answers and reassurance and then I get the reassurance I need and it's still not enough. And then at night it gets even worse. I can't sleep. I spend all nighters just scrolling and scrolling on Reddit and Google for answers that I already know.

**What do I do?** I already went to the emergency room once and they prescribed me something for nausea because at first we thought it was some sort of stomach flu but we've figured out since then that it's not and it's just the stress. I can't go get anti anxiety meds or anything like that because that stuff gets put on record and I can't afford that being on my record. I also cannot afford actual genuine therapy. My parents are tired of me and have told me I have until January to fix this or I can't go to college anymore because if this continues I won't be able to handle my classes at all.

What's happening to me? What do I do? Please help...

TL;DR : 18 Male. I had an inconvenience with college professor. Anxiety from that point grows as more situations happen. Anxiety reached crippling point and am experiencing vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, huge weight loss, insomnia, and antisocial behavior. Extremely minor things like writing my own name now cause me unreasonable stress. Constantly seeking reassurance, receives reassurance from professionals, stress remains the same. High-school me wouldn't react this way.

Edit: What I mean by reassurance is that I have made decisions and I am constantly reassured by others that my decision was on point and perfect to the point where further action is unnecessary. I have even gotten professionals to reassure me, and I know everything is going to be okay. However, despite this, the topics that cause me stress still drive me into this spiral of anxiety, even though I usually wouldn't react this way.

For months (arguably years) I've been trying to build habits into my routine that I know betters my quality of life. 15-minute cleaning sessions, daily  dental care, daily make-up, creative expression. My therapist corrects me on my 'failure' language but the truth is I'm stuck here, and she keeps asking me why I can't maintain these small habits, and the answer is- I don't know! I'm stuck! 

I was interested in somatic therapy and EMDR because I thought it was the way to give myself more of an ability to do these things- but I guess not. I can't muster up the discipline, motivation, or energy to keep these things up. I have gotten the hang of starting off well by 'dissociating' from what I 'feel' doing or 'want' to do. If I 'just do it' I can get it done, but then this only lasts for a few weeks before I start neglecting myself again.

My environment makes a huge difference, and I recently moved which made things worse, but it was necessary because where I was previously was a college campus and I was very mentally underprepared for school and hence very burned out. I still feel burned out. The things people suggest to do to get out of burn out are things I'm having trouble maintaining. And on and on.

See the loop I'm stuck in? Have you experienced this and worked through it? Am I going about it wrong? Maybe I should start smaller, hold out longer, or maybe I'm limiting myself by considering it being 'stuck'. I'm not sure but I'd appreciate some advice.",burnout

I have a pretty extensive childhood trauma history, and I‚Äôve done everything I can imagine to try and get better. I would have considered myself ‚Äúfine‚Äù before a TBI a few years ago. Then covid isolation really just made things so much worse. 

When I first had my TBI, that‚Äôs when panic attacks started. I went to an NP and he put me on Lexapro and Wellbutrin, which landed me in the ER a week later with serotonin syndrome. Ever since then I have had a medication fear and I‚Äôve never even been able to take a Xanax because of it.

As far as therapy goes, I‚Äôve done EMDR, CBT, somatic, IFS, ART, OCD therapy, and traditional talk therapy. I have spent literally thousands of dollars over 10 years to feel better. I‚Äôve read probably a hundred self help books. The good feeling lasts for a while, then the darkness always comes back.

I would describe it as a deep grief that nothing can touch. It‚Äôs like having a curse from my past, kind of like how Harry and Luna can see the Thestrals but no one else can. 

Ever since Covid, my agoraphobia and OCD has grown deafening. My life has gotten so much smaller. It impacts my ability to take care of myself, with my current battle being that I need to have a wisdom tooth removed and when I tried IV sedation a couple weeks ago, I had an extreme reaction to the ‚Äúcalming‚Äù medicine and had to leave. Now I‚Äôm trying to figure out my next move but my phobias feel overwhelming. 

I feel hopeless, honestly. Nothing seems like the right answer. Google says to do ‚Äúbreathing exercises‚Äù or ‚Äútalk to a therapist.‚Äù I‚Äôm so tired of this. I wouldn‚Äôt describe myself as suicidal, but I am tired. I don‚Äôt know how I can move past this mountain of a phobia to get my teeth fixed, and it‚Äôs destroying me when I was doing so good up until this. It kinda makes me feel like I‚Äôll never truly get better. I‚Äôm not sleeping well. I feel sick to my stomach as my surgery date looms closer, and I cannot picture myself being able to do it.

Thanks for reading if you did, I‚Äôm just tired and I wish I could pay for a medical procedure to fix my brain once and for all. I live a healthy lifestyle. I have a healthy relationship. I have a job. I take care of my responsibilities. I don‚Äôt drink alcohol or do drugs. But feeling this way makes me think all my effort just to be ‚Äúokay‚Äù is a waste when it all seems to not matter in the face of a challenge. ",burnout
1gg9ue5,Is this burnout? I need advice after my first 7 months of practice in another country ,therapy,1730364112.0,0,2,"Hello everyone,

I will try to keep my story short but with enough details. I graduated in September 2023 in Transylvania and after having a member of my family propose me a job as a dentist in a clinic she is an associate in ( in France), I accepted and started learning French 6 months prior to having my language test and move there to start working. 
I had 3 months of staying and assisting arround ( mainly observing as I wasn‚Äôt allowed to do anything until I had all my papers in order even though I was already accepted by the Order of the Dentists). 
Since the beginning there were a lot of problems with my relative‚Äôs associate and the secretary of the clinic at the point where she clearly stated she would do everything in her power so that I don‚Äôt work there and that everything will go wrong for me. With the help of a lawyer and my relative, we continued and I started working this April. 
Since then, I had to get myself used to : being a new dentist as I have never practiced before in a clinic, talking to patients and explaining procedures, treatment plans, working without an assistant, getting used to all the protocols of the clinic regarding the documentation for patients, the appointments, planning the schedule 2-3 months in advance, learning the French dental system, insurance policies and reimbursements for the patients, learning the administrative and secretarial system, new sterilisation protocols, having to complete mandatory courses, finishing paperwork and all this is a whole new different language ( my 5th). 

It was a lot but I told myself I‚Äôm gonna make it. 

Clearly, I did a few mistakes along the way, mostly on the secretarial administrative part and regarding the quotes for the patients that they had to send to the insurance company, as there are quite a few things to take into consideration in the French system with the 100% reimbursed, moderately and non-reimbursed. But in the end, nothing too serious or without a solution. 

The problem was that I was not receiving a lot of help from either part, my relative had it tough when she came in France also 20 years ago and think that ( more or less) it s normal for me to have it just as tough also. The secretary started getting angry and annoyed every time I would ask a question more than 2-3 times or do a mistake cause ‚Äú she likes things done perfectly and I don‚Äôt know how to do anything‚Äù, and then would also complain I do not communicate with her. But when asked why she is so rude and though towards me the response was always ‚Äúso I learn better‚Äù. Even after i expressed to my employer ( my relative) that I do not works like that, I cannot communicate with people who belittle and talk in a tone of superiority in everything to me, the situation continued. 

I have reached a point where I had a verbal altercation with the secretary, after having forgotten to do something for my relative that she imposed on me while I was also in a moment I was doing sterilisation, helping another colleague and being late for my next patient. I was told I am good at nothing, I never learn, that since April there is no improvement in anything I do, and that I am always forgetful and can‚Äôt be trusted with anything ( all of which I find to be exaggerated accusations) 

I feel burnt-out, I started having anxiety about work, I feel like I‚Äôm not good at anything I‚Äôm doing, even when 80% of  my patients are happy and some also tell me how I have changed their perspective on dental appointments, I still feel a sense of hopelessness, depression, I feel alone and overwhelmed. 

My relative, who is also very aware of all the problems, as her last 2-3 collaborators also left because of this, promised moving to another place that she started building last year. But I cannot wait and endure this any longer, I fear for my wellbeing.. and I want to leave even if I feel indebted to her for helping me move to France. 

What would you do in my situation?

1ebecwl,Is this a mental breakdown? was this just burnout?,therapy,1721859465.0,1,0,"A few years ago I was in college. I was working fine, up until mid point and end of the semester. I was anxious of everything and could not even approach my teachers anymore... especially a teacher that got annoyed with me over my hiding and inability to talk to her. I could not do my college work anymore and was trying what I could to push through. The work just stressed me out, I only did the smaller work and took it at a piece at a time. There were a few classes that I ended up failing, though. 

I went to work like normal, but maybe slightly more anxious than normal. 

To this day, anything that reminds me or is related to my coursework, I cannot do. Makes me anxious. 

I graduated since I was already far in that major, the other courses were dropped because they were for a cert.

Severe burnout‚Ä¶I need help

Yeah. I‚Äôm an ambitious college student who worked their ass off to get somewhere far in life. Previously, (the last few years) I had been going through really bad family issues which resulted in my homelessness. Luckily, I was able to cope with the problem since I had other kind people who helped me out. After the fight with my fam, I have been busy trying to reach above and beyond academically. Graduated high school with high honors and now I go to a decent college majoring in a like-able field, aiming to go to law school. 

Honestly, I am not complaining about where I am in life. I am just exhausted. I am really exhausted about all of this. My classes, my job, my fellowship‚Ä¶everything. I was once a curious and an active person, now, I feel dead and lazy. I have no curiosity in my academics anymore and every time I sit down to do work, I end up scrolling on social media or blanking out (prolly dissociating). Because of this, my grades significantly dropped. I feel worse about everything. Every time I acknowledge my burnout and poor mental health, I get angry‚Ä¶I think that I am giving myself a pass/excuse to perform badly in college and glorifying laziness to myself. I want to take a break, but if I do, everything might fall apart. I might lose everything and now that I‚Äôm near graduating college, I can‚Äôt afford to miss out on opportunities. But at the same time, The smallest and easiest classes and lessons seem hard for me to understand‚Ä¶I struggle to focus, and sometimes resolve to watching erotic content lately (regrettably, too often). I really want to take a break with all of this without having to compromise myself or my responsibilities. 

This is why, I would deeply appreciate if I could receive a few words of encouragement and advice on how to manage my life. I want to live, until the very end. Thanks. ",burnout

1d2cjbw,Therapy making autistic burnout worse,therapy,1716876280.0,1,0,"Hello. I‚Äôm diagnosed with autism, BPD, anxiety, ADHD, and PTSD. I‚Äôd like to think my BPD is on the ‚Äúmilder‚Äù side which im certain it is. Anyway, I‚Äôve went through four therapists in the last five years and im exhausted. I currently have a good therapist, she‚Äôs the best I‚Äôve had, but I live in rural Kentucky so, my options are slim to none. She‚Äôs not very educated on autism, and I‚Äôve helped her understand a lot, and I don‚Äôt mind explaining things to therapists, because i understand that they are also human. However, things just keep getting added to my list of things to keep up with. I have a case manager that I don‚Äôt really need right now and I‚Äôve told her that, but alas, here I am, and now I have a new girl who is supposed to help me with DBT homework. I‚Äôve been in burnout for months. 

Many, many things have happened. I understand that with the diagnosis‚Äôs I have, I can‚Äôt just dip out. However, the predictability of what a therapist would say (isolation is a form of self sabotage, blah blah blah) is just..tiring. I know this sounds like im full of myself but I‚Äôve been recognizing patterns all of my life and studying how people behave (I also have a huge special interest in psychology) so though I don‚Äôt have a degree, I can almost exactly predict which course of action the therapists are gonna take. I know what they‚Äôre gonna say. I know what they‚Äôre going to tell me, because I also tell myself those things. There‚Äôs no denying I need therapy, but I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶exhausted. It‚Äôs difficult to speak (literally) what do I do? I‚Äôve also voiced these things too, by the way. Every therapist I‚Äôve had, sometimes, when I‚Äôm especially burnt out, I‚Äôll dumb myself down or act like I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre gonna do or say, to make them feel good because it makes them happy. The lack of understanding of autism (especially in rural areas) is horrific. I just want a break. I understand that consistency is key, and there‚Äôs the fear of me backsliding, but I feel tired from this. I dread seeing these people. Also, my case manager inserts her own opinions into things and seems to have really strange ideas of how humans operate. I was telling her about how my middle school bullies all had a bunch of kids now, and she told me ‚Äúpeople in their early 20‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt have kids because they‚Äôre basically a child‚Äù. Which, is untrue. Also‚Ä¶.? Why she saying these things?

 Also, they don‚Äôt have any idea about how the autistic/adhd brain works. My psychiatrist (very good woman) tells me that I‚Äôll be more delayed, socially, at least, and I am. But my case manager insists that most brains are developed at 25. Who cares? I dread seeing these people Wednesday.

1h68vqk,Therapist says I'm a dry addict/alcoholic ,therapy,1733290471.0,6,2,"And I believe her. I've got 9 months of clean time minus being on MAT. I went to rehab for 3 months in the very beginning and loved it. I was maybe not doing all that I could have been doing while in rehab but daily meetings were required, you had to get up at a certain time early in the morning, had to make your bed, went to the treatment program, hung out with other clean addicts and tried to have fun as a newly sober human being. 

When I got out of rehab, I moved into an Oxford house sober living home. Been here since. I live with, now 6 (one just moved) guys. For the most part it's great. It's definitely helped me stay clean since if I use I get kicked out. That being said When I got out of rehab, I immediately stopped going to meetings. I do some online meetings on zoom because technically I'm required to attend at least 3 meetings a week for Oxford house but sometimes I don't even do the 3 online ones. I still haven't got a sponsor in 9 months and technically that's another requirement for Oxford house, it's just my house has been kind of lenient with me on it. 

I stay up till 4am on average binging TV or playing video games. Waking up somewhere after 4pm. I started going back to school but it's online classes and I'm almost 2 weeks behind. I work but I'm self employed, doing deliveries for Doordash and Uber Eats. It's not very good pay now but I've been doing it for a living exclusively, for 5 years now and it always pays the bills at least. Plus I'm getting financial aid but I notice when I get it I basically stop working altogether and go through a depressive slump. Hell I started this year getting an inheritance of like 30k when my grandmother passed. That was gone by the 2nd month of being in sober living. How? I don't know. I paid taxes on it and fixed my car and paid rent for a few months but outside of that I haven't a clue.

People said that getting sober would change everything and I'd feel so much better and I do but I don't. I'm still depressed, anxious, socially isolated, have no clue how to have fun, still feel stuck and unmotivated, I have no family that cares, the friends I have I live with and barely interact with. I have very little interest in using or drinking, there's that at least. 

So yeah, maybe she's right I'm a dry addict. Do I want to be, no. I want so much more for my life but am still lost on how to navigate towards anything worthwhile. 

I ditched the therapist and am going to look for a new one. She was an addiction counselor but mostly just acted like a life coach. Setting goals every session and talking about doing the stuff I continually didn't do. It felt like a chore making it to the sessions and I dreaded it because 99% of the time I had barely accomplished anything that week. What I need I think, is a real therapist. One who'll maybe dig into the roots of why I am the way that I am so that those areas can heal. Mostly I think I just need someone to openly talk things out with. She always did the talking and overpowered me if I tried to direct the conversation somewhere else.

During therapy this week, my therapist and I discussed both the relationship and its demise.  My therapist said that it sounded like my ex has alcohol dependency issues. Why?
- He drinks fairly regularly (various amounts almost every day)
- He can drink a lot (easily a bottle or two of wine in a sitting)
- A few weeks prior to our break up, he received alarming results on a medical test that indicated extremely high levels of GGT (ie a damaged liver). While he seemed concerned at the time, he attributed these results to something other than alcohol. When I went to visit him not long after these results he drank as he normally does - which is a lot. 

My therapist‚Äôs opinion was: a sensible person would minimise/cut out all drinking if they received worrying liver test results. If you choose to ignore that you‚Äôre unwell, you most likely have a dependency issue.

So basically sessions consist of him saying, ‚Äúhey stop using substances.‚Äù Which doesn‚Äôt seem to add a damn thing to my life. I asked outright if we could talk about my fear around the interviewing process and how to handle things like explaining legal charges and employment gaps. Nope. He said, ‚Äúif substances aren‚Äôt in your way of doing those things, prove it.‚Äù Well of course they‚Äôre in the way to some extent, but so are a lot of other things.

1fjvsc2,My partner's mother died and I'm thinking about leaving him ,therapy,1726673725.0,65,25,"Hello everyone. My partner (29M) and I (28F) have been together for a couple of years now. We also have a 10 month old child together. My partner's mother passed away almost a month ago and since her passing, his actions have been absolutely baffling. He's been pushing me away which doesn't allow me to be there for him during this difficult time. He ""doesn't know"" how to process through this tragic event. When I do talk to him, his answers are very short and surface level even if we're not on the topic of his mom.

Just a backstory, he grew up in a very dysfunctional household with his mother who was addicted to opiates and would verbally and sometimes physically abuse him. He has never gone to therapy for the trauma he experienced as a child. 

He works a job where if they suspect him of using any illegal substances, he gets fired. He started smoking weed out of the blue which could potentially put his job in jeopardy if his boss found out and would financially ruin our family if he lost his job. He's spent over $1000 in 4 days on who knows what which has put our family in a difficult financial situation and we're unable to pay our bills. He's withdrawn cash for God knows what and when I ask him about it, he says he ""doesn't remember"". The only reason I believe he would pull out cash, is because he's doing things that he shouldn't be and doesn't want me to find out.

I'm at the point now to where I don't know how much more I can take with him. I'm starting to see that his mentally is that of a teenager in a man's body. I don't think he was ever taught how to be a man and how to process and handle changes in life. He doesn't know how to be a responsible adult and being quite frank, his actions have been nothing but selfish. He seems to only consider what he wants and how he feels. As terrible as this sounds, I don't think that his mom's passing should be an excuse to put his job, relationship, and finances in jeopardy. We've been in this sort of ""parent and child"" relationship for a while now where I'm constantly reminding him to pay bills, help out around the house, and take care of other tasks that I need help with. I already have 1 child and don't need to be responsible for a grown man child as well. I'm so close to walking away from this relationship cause there's too many problems. I know that sounds terrible to even be thinking about leaving someone while they're grieving the loss of a parent but I can't take it anymore. There's so many problems that have crept up in a short period of time and he's not handling these things in a healthy way. His actions are starting to affect our family and I have to look out for mine and my daughters wellbeing. Someone has to be responsible and step up and I don't see it being him. I need some advice on what to do in this situation. He just recently booked a therapy appointment for Monday but with the amount of baggage he has, it could take years for him to implement what he learns into daily living and I don't know if I want to wait that long. 

TL;DR My partner's recent actions after his mom's passing have put us in a difficult financial situation, is ruining our relationship, and my resentment towards him is growing. I'm thinking about leaving him. Advice needed. ",substance abuse
1ic464z,How do you get the therapy sessions shown on TV/movies?,therapy,1738078347.0,29,8,"I don‚Äôt understand how therapy is supposed to work. On TV and in movies, therapy sessions involve real substantial conversations and dig into childhood, relationships, trauma. That has not been my experience. 

I just got off a first therapy session after 2 years - probably my 5th time trying therapy in my life - and it was the same as any other, probably worse. The therapist ran through her list of obligated questions for 15 minutes of our 45 minute time, and then said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll send you some worksheets and see you next week.‚Äù

I told her I‚Äôm a child of divorce. I told her my prior substance abuse issue. I told her I‚Äôve been diagnosed with depression. I told her my latest mood swing caused an argument in my relationship. And she‚Äôs sending me a worksheet. No follow up questions, not one. 

I get it, these things take time and I‚Äôll be honest, I haven‚Äôt really stuck therapy out for very long when I try it. But come on, like???

I‚Äôve literally never had a good therapist experience. One was so booked we could only meet every 2 weeks and she would literally forget everything we talked about and it was 2 months of the same conversation. One tried to blame my issues on generational oppression. One ended the session after 5 minutes because I was feeling better after a depressive episode and said I was ‚Äúall good.‚Äù

I‚Äôm actively trying to seek help here and if I wanted a damn worksheet, I would Google one. I want to get help from a professional and actually try to fix or at least cope better with the things I‚Äôm experiencing. 

Is there a different type of therapy I should be seeking out or something? Is therapy just not for me and I should go touch grass?",substance abuse

She has asked me every session ‚Äúyou‚Äôre close with your mom right?‚Äù I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm in therapy to help handle the trauma of my childhood.

She just reads off worksheets. We do nothing that‚Äôs actually usable in dealing with trauma. She tries to help me communicate with my parents. Instead, she reads a worksheet off and says ‚Äúwell this won‚Äôt be helpful to communicate with your parents.‚Äù 

She told me her political beliefs. When I discuss arguments over politics, I only say that I differ from others in my life. I have never said whether I lean left or right. But she has.

She puts me in these different programs all the time. She told me I needed anger management so for like 3 weeks she talked about how I‚Äôm not really angry, I‚Äôm just feeling another emotion.

These things have made me uncomfortable. Like I shouldn‚Äôt know about your ex husband‚Äôs substance abuse while you‚Äôre asking me if I‚Äôm close with my mom.

1j5kxrq,How f*cked up is f*cked up?,therapy,1741345151.0,4,4,"I 14(M) have problems caring. I've been looking for a job as of late with no luck (surprising I know). But I don't seem to really care for it still knowing I need a job to help me in building prototypes for a business I want to make. I have gone through more work to not go to school than it is to just do the work because I feel like taking the risk whatever it is and just walk away from the school after I'm dropped off. I honestly couldn't care less for school as it's the bane of my existence.

 Not because of the homework or the social life. But because it's not a good place for really anyone. For half my life I've asked one question..... ""Can I learn ahead? Can I work more? How can I perform better?"" And ever giving time I got hit with the same ""no your doing just fine"" or ""no just follow the class"" and when I started to go ahead anyway (still getting stuff right because we learning from a book and I can just learn from there) I GOT A PHONE CALL HOME FOR INSUBORDINATION FOR LEARNING FASTER! and you just know I got incredible at home since the teacher made it seem like I get cussed her and her entire family out. 

So yea a little traumatic to me wanting to learn. So because of that I slowly have up in school and figured on dissociating myself from the world with videogames and later on substances. Ever since I was born cannabis has been around me, my dad was always slightly high because of medical complication (it's prescribed) and my mom was also using plus meth. Parents got divorced few years ago, it was a big fight and I even got kidnapped by my mom once which created the start of me no longer trusting her. My dad went a little into the loony bin but it's still highly functional. I mean for F*CKS SAKE HE THINKS HE'S THE SECOND COMING OF CRIST. 

Half my school does weed so that shit is just pressed onto me. It's my only outlet that I can do socially so you know what kind of friends I have. And it's not like I have it bad either I love in the suburbs for Christs sake. So now I have imposter syndrome since I don't think I have it bad, even though I spent years in bad parts of Florida. (If you know you know). Went to a middle school were fights broke out every which way. My dad has an abusive dad so he made sure I wasn't traumatized by him. (I thank him for that greatly). But he did it to much plus with my mom being over protective and moving around a lot I never learned how to have tough skin or how to read a room or figure out social cues. 

Then we get to me wanting to make a contracting business for government weapons design and manufacturing. Which stems from me wanting to be the reason why someone doesn't go home that day. Which is truly f*cked up in a way I can't understand I know ok? And it's not because I think it's cool or because I like being on a power trip. It's because I hate feeling weak, I want to play God a little. I want to have power over others than them having power over me. I've seen people die peacefully and horribly (Internet and real life kind of) and all I can think is, those people killing them are in total control.

 They have all that power that they can decide their fate. Now I do want to bring up that I would never do something like that I would never be able to live with myself and my family will cut contact with me. But I can't help but stay up at night thinking about being that person in control. And I'm sitting in my bed almost 5 in the morning no sleep. About to eat something and force myself to throwup to pretend I'm sick because that better than going to school. And yes I know I still have to do the work in the end. But I just can't help myself.

 I'm not sure what to do because if I tell anyone this irl they will never lol at me the same again. And this isn't even all of it but I didn't really have much time left before I go out to eat breakfast. I'll update this later.",substance abuse

1jlxe2v,"Executive director of addiction center talked to my therapist, is this HIPAA violation?",therapy,1743174836.0,7,1,"I was part of an IOP program that I found to be unsatisfactory, and I voiced my complaints to the executive director of the addiction recovery center (this is a large organization, like over 1000 people in addiction treatment). This executive director is in charge of the entire Behavioral Health center, so pretty high up. I've had conversations over email, and also over Zoom video to discuss my issues with their curriculum. I said I voiced my complaints as an individual patient.

  
Today, I had a session with my therapist, and my therapist said that this executive director came up to her, and asked that the focus of therapy be more focused on my own recovery, and not so much on curricular changes.

I found this super inappropriate, that this director talked to my therapist about my complaints for the IOP program. I took this as a means of intimidation, or at least overstepping boundaries. 

I don't believe this director should have access to who my therapist is. Does being a director give her permission then, to view other parts of my record, like my psychiatrist, my health history, etc? Or am I correct in believing this is a HIPAA violation?

1jjyrtd,I put an abrupt stop to my moms addiction.,therapy,1742948158.0,6,4,"My mom 64f has had a gambling addiction her whole life but especially an addiction to this sweepstakes company called PCH. 

She has been filling entries for them for the past 40 years and as they turned to the internet and phones her addiction got worse. Spending up to 6 hours a day on the computer ignoring her family. I have very vivid memories of me being a toddler and asking for food and she would ignore me or tell me to wait. As i got older i learned just to make my own food but obviously as a 3 year old i couldnt cook and relied on her for any food. 

Well even later in childhood i would get hurt or something id have to bandage myself. If she promised to do somwthing with the family it would end in a broken promise because she valued pch more than us. 

This last year she learned they had an app for the phone and her 6 hours of computer time skyrocketed to 12+ hours a day of computer AND phone. She stopped getting out of bed and getting dressed most days unless we forced her to and that came with a ton of fighting. 

It put a huge strain on the our relationship as a whole. So today i did something i will probably regret. 

I emailed the company and asked them if they could limit the time spent on their website or lock her account. Which they did and responded back an hour later. 

My mom doesnt understand why she cant log in and now im worried she will figure out i was behind it. 

I did try to talk to her about this and how its unhealthy before but she just compared it to how we watch movies or play video games and read books. Which is no where near identical because none of us spend 6+ hours a day doing those things and completely ignore responsibilities. 

Im just tired of all the fighting and wanted to feel like an actual family. My dad has CHF and doesnt have much longer i think and i just want to try and have a few REAL family memories before its impossible altogether. 

Did i mess up by doing this? Should i have just let her keep wasting what time she has left on something meaningless? 

Im worried she will contact them and they'll give me away and it will just break out in a larger fight but she never listened  before when i tried to have a meaningful heart to heart with her. 

My hope is that she will just give up trying to get online and find healthier hobbies to fill the time with but im unsure.

1jnqpvb,I'm an addict in recovery with a partner in active addiction. Am I enabling him?,therapy,1743380405.0,5,0,"When I first met my boyfriend (29M) we were both sober and in recovery, I've always been in constant treatment, and we always helped each other but about 6/7 month in the relationship he relapsed. At first, I tried my best to help, told me he had to start treatment again, something he never did, and even said if he did it again I wasn't going to stay.

Sadly, he relapsed again, twice and even got high next to me. As I sat next to him while he came down from the high, I told him how I was getting anxious to relapse, and he was willing to give me drugs. Something I'd never expected from him. Thankfully, I stopped myself. After this, he was sober around two weeks, constantly putting off all his therapy appointments and justifying himself by saying he was fine. He was earning great money in a job he liked, and was getting along with his family, who thought he was sober. So to him that meant it was fine and he wouldn't do it again. As an addict myself, I believe I can spot the signs and know all the lies we tell the ones we love. Since he got no treatment and changed nothing, he relapsed. So I broke up with him.

The weekend we broke up he begged me to come back, promised to get help, and I caved in making it a condition for him to get treatment. He always had some excuse as to why he hadn't been to the appointments and began using every weekend, using in my house and trying to hide it all the time. I've tried my best to help, but it's really getting to me, and honestly I feel like I'm enabling him at this point. I try to set limits like saying I won't see him until he acts lie an adult and gets help, but when I do, he just reminds me how he's been for me when I cry or feel bad.

I am emotionally exhausted. I can't take it anymore. I just can't. This is somehow my last attempt to gather some strength.

Somehow, it all started... or maybe it has always been like this. I have always sought validation from others, especially since puberty. I never truly knew who *I* really was. There was no Martin, just a version of me that fit into whatever my current friend group wanted.

For example, in 2017 ‚Äì I thought it was cool to drink excessively, to commit small stupid thefts, just to fit in. In doing so, I destroyed so much. The trust of my parents, my own path in life.

At some point, I distanced myself from that group of friends and tried to slowly rebuild my life. I still partied a lot, but I think my problem was that I never really worked on myself. I just pushed everything aside and ignored it.

Then it continued. My relationship with my mother was never particularly good. I never really spoke openly with her. And at some point, especially since puberty, it completely fell apart. I withdrew a lot from my family. I just wanted to please others.

Then, at the beginning of 2019, I met my ex-girlfriend. And this girl was the best and most beautiful thing I had ever felt. After half a year, I was on vacation, and my then-friends told me that she would cheat on me when she was in Italy. And what did I do? Once again, I didn't think for myself, I didn't listen to my own feelings ‚Äì I just believed what my friends said. And yeah, what can I say? I didn't do what *I* wanted, I did what I thought others would approve of. I kissed someone else.

Still, we were together for five years, and during that time, we were extremely close. I don‚Äôt think I ever truly grew as a person. I have a deep fear of being alone. I don‚Äôt even know if I exist for *myself* ‚Äì or if my whole life just exists to please others.

But things only got truly bad recently. My ex-girlfriend provided me with a lot of stability throughout my final school years. After graduation, we spent almost a year traveling together. It was beautiful ‚Äì but it was unbalanced. She planned a lot, took initiative, wanted to build something for herself. And me? I just leaned on her. I think I saw her more as a support than as a partner.

Then came 2023. I moved to Mannheim to study. At the beginning of 2024, I said I couldn't do it anymore ‚Äì mentally. And it was true. But once again, I had ruined my own life. I had lost control over myself ‚Äì again because of partying, again because I wanted to fit in, again because I didn‚Äôt take anything seriously. I only studied because I thought that‚Äôs what others expected of me. And then it was all over again. I had to start from scratch. I had *once again* ruined everything.

In February 2024, my girlfriend broke up with me. I moved back to my hometown and quit my job because I simply couldn't do it anymore.

I have serious problems addressing things directly or taking action. The way others perceive me is incredibly important to me ‚Äì I want to be the cool one, the popular one. Back in Braunschweig, I reconnected with some old friends. I lost myself in partying. It wasn‚Äôt healthy, but it also wasn‚Äôt the end of the world. My life wasn‚Äôt moving forward ‚Äì and that frustrated me.

But then things got even worse, to the point where I hit rock bottom.

In the summer, I met new people ‚Äì a group of Atzen, through a close friend I‚Äôve known since 2018. I didn‚Äôt want to be with my old friend group anymore; I wanted to belong to these new, cool people ‚Äì and I did everything for that.

One night, there was a fight. I immediately jumped in to help. But honestly, I only did it for validation. I thought: This is my chance to prove that I belong. Now I have a court date for aggravated assault.

That summer, I also met my current girlfriend. It was wonderful, and this girl makes me incredibly happy. But I don‚Äôt know if she is really *the one* ‚Äì or if I just have such an intense fear of being alone that I *need* this love.

It feels like my life keeps repeating itself. I keep making the same mistakes, keep falling down. In the relationship, I am sometimes incredibly happy ‚Äì and then I feel like I‚Äôm missing validation or love. I *always* need more.

And then things got even worse. I started doing drugs. First, a lot of coke, then Benzos. Last Saturday, I took seven substances at once ‚Äì alcohol, ketamine, weed, Benzos, speed, cocaine... everything. Since then, I have felt empty, cold, dead inside.

I told my girlfriend that I had stopped, but I lied. I kept going. I ruined everything.

In mid-February, I had a complete breakdown. I was so hurt that I felt absolutely nothing anymore ‚Äì just a deep, dark emptiness. And I made another mistake. I kissed someone else.

Now, I have issues with that friend group as well, I am no longer liked, I have gotten myself into debt, my studies feel like a dead end, I don‚Äôt go to work. I can‚Äôt do this anymore.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like I have destroyed my entire life. I feel like I am alone. Completely alone.

17ktlet,Therapist was very concerned when I revealed I was going to start microdosing,therapy,1698781593.0,40,34,"I have a new therapist I‚Äôve been seeing for about two months now. I have told them in the past I‚Äôve had issues with alcohol and cocaine. I have worked on my life a lot and I generally like to ‚Äúshow up‚Äù for it. I also have better self esteem. Now that im older hangovers are much worse and that is a big repellant from drinking. Cocaine has come through a couple of times but I‚Äôve felt pretty meh about it. I view my addictions as a result of having undiagnosed ADHD, low self esteem, and depression. I wanted to get high because my life sucked. My life doesn‚Äôt suck anymore. 7 months ago I got put on an SSNRI for ADHD and it‚Äôs been helpful.

Unfortunately despite moving away from doing drugs and drinking, I still experience bouts of depression, especially in the winter it seems I get very bad seasonal affective disorder. Well, a chill sets in and the sky is dark and what do you know? I start feeling depressed and hopeless. Stopped taking care of myself and taking my meds, quit going to work (I‚Äôm a contractor and they were low on work anyway so it lined up okay). So I decide to do something about it before it gets bad! I had my loving partner come over and hold me and help me clean my room and get me into the shower. He went out with me while I ran errands I was dreading and helped me talk through some of my feelings. Then we went and picked up some mushrooms from a trusted friend because after last winters bout of SAD I thought this would be helpful for me to microdose through winter. I‚Äôve generally had very positive experiences with mushrooms.

Talked to my therapist today and was open about it. He would not drop it and thinks this isn‚Äôt going to be good for me and said I was getting defensive when he was saying that. I explained that because I‚Äôve had problems with particular drugs doesn‚Äôt mean I have problems with all drugs and I don‚Äôt like being responded to like an addict. He also said he thinks other things I was doing like working on healthy eating habits and spending time making art are more sustainable ways to feel the stability I‚Äôm after. I want to do those things in addition to microdosing and I feel I will have an easier time getting up to do that stuff when I‚Äôm feeling better. He also said he didn‚Äôt want to try doing some of the work we were planning on because it‚Äôll do more harm if I‚Äôm under the influence? He thinks mushrooms are a ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù. Maybe they are but then aren‚Äôt all drugs, including the SSNRI I was prescribed? I am back on my meds and have taken the single micro dose and feel a lot better already. I don‚Äôt feel high, I feel able to get up and do stuff. What‚Äôs his deal? Should I just tell him I heard his concerns and decided not to do them and continue doing them?",cocaine

I saw my grandmother who took care of me, pass away when I was 6 and my dad passed away this February, and my mom's getting old, her 70th birthday was on October. I get anxiety attacks because I fear my mom will pass away anytime now, but selfishly, I get them mostly because I know I will die eventually. 

My friend thinks its because of drugs(cocaine, weed sometimes, Adderall sometimes) and drinking causes me to feel this way. It would randomly just pop up out of nowhere, I was just watching a nfl highlight reel and it just pops up out of nowhere. Is there any mental or physical practices I can do when I get these attacks that will help? 

I used to take solace that reincarnation is possible, but then I realized that even if it is, I won't remember it. So ultimately it is my fear of losing my consciousness, my memories, that I fear the most. Thank you everyone for taking the time to read this.

1f72err,"Sex, drugs and a lifetime of therapy?",therapy,1725268714.0,2,1,"For context, my mom left my schizophrenic bio dad when I was 3 and was raised  by my stepfather since age 5.

When I was 8 I found a pile of cocaine under my parents bed, on a family picture of the 3 of us.

At age 9 while in Mammoth at a hotel, my mom and step dad had sex in the bed while I slept on the floor at the foot of the bed. I was sleeping but woke up to hearing them.

At age 10 my mom had my brother(1/2 brother)

At age 11 my mom and step dad would regularly make me watch my brother while they had loud sex in the shower. It was a normal Sunday morning for me.

At age 11 I came home with my yearbook. Fellow students had written dirty language and drawn dirty pictures in it. My stepdad saw it and was very upset. I told him I didn‚Äôt do it. He made me pull my pants down, bend over in front of a mirror and paddled me over and over.

At age 12 I was sitting on a couch in the living room, my stepdad on the other couch. Middle of the day, stepdad was masturbating himself over his shorts. I could see his erect penis through his clothes.

At age 12 I found a pile of cocaine again in my parents closet, on the same picture. I confronted my mom who had just used it. I remember hearing her in her locked room and knew the sound of the razor blade on the glass.

At age 13 we were on our way home from a river trip. It was late and dark. I was in the backseat with my friend and my brother in his car seat. My friend woke me up because my parents were fooling around in the front seat. He had his hand down my mom‚Äôs pants and then she gave my step dad a blowjob. 

I had blocked most of this out of memory until just a few years ago my friend who was in the back seat messaged me on Facebook asking if I had remembered the incident. I hadn‚Äôt but in that moment all this came flooding back into memory. I hadn‚Äôt spoken to him in almost 2 decades, he said how much it messed him up and how proud of me he was. We don‚Äôt talk.

At 15 my mom and step dad divorced, the exposure was over. But my mom proceeded to remarry 3 more times. The man she married after my step dad convinced her to move the Las Vegas from San Diego where we lived immediately after I graduated high school. I was moving back and forth between moms and step dads homes at the time. I hated her new man, he lied and embellished about everything. About 2 years after moving to LV he got cancer and died within 6 months. Less than a year later mom married his best friend. I learned later it was a fake wedding so she could keep a monthly payment coming from Mr. Embellishers benefits. Mom remarried again(not legally to keep that check coming) and has been with him for over 15 years. He‚Äôs a decent guy but surprise surprise he likes to embellish too. Mom now has dementia so there is little hope of any resolve with her.

I don‚Äôt talk to or see step dad anymore. But he continues to show up in my dreams. To be fair he taught me how to ride a motorcycle and a trade, I happen to be pretty good at both. I‚Äôm grateful and also bothered by those things.

1cfv6vb,I feel so lost,therapy,1714384435.0,1,0,"I‚Äôm not sure if this is the type of thing the mods would allow here but here goes. I‚Äôm  Sorry that it‚Äôs so long and I‚Äôm sorry for my poor grammar and punctuation. 

Yes I‚Äôm seeking professional help, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be going anywhere. I don‚Äôt usually know how to articulate my feelings and even when I can they are usually so overbearing that my mind and mouth can‚Äôt quite put them into words. Trying to write them out after the depressive episode always feels fake and forced and trying to shed light on them and putting them on paper always feels like I‚Äôm looking for some sort of validation. Honestly I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for, I just don‚Äôt want to feel like this. 

A little back ground into my mental health: I used to be a bright kid with a bright future, or so I was told. I‚Äôm 30 now,and a few years back I found psychadelics. It was purely psychadelics as I had it in my head that they aren‚Äôt as bad as ‚Äúhard drugs‚Äù like meth, heroin, cocaine, etc. so LSD, DMT, and psilocybin were my drugs of choice. I convinced my self that I was on some sort of spiritual journey and that they would help me be a better person or they would help me be more creative and this and that, blah blah blah. The more I went down the rabbit hole, the more the drugs felt like they were stealing from me in some way, like they were giving me fantastical experiences but would take some part of my mind in return, the more it felt like I had been lulled into some sneaky trap of the mind, some sort of spiritual manipulation, a war of the mind. I couldn‚Äôt go a day without realizing some epiphany of life, or so it felt. Deeper the epiphanies went, the more meaningless life got. Thankfully I have someone who supports me well enough to see the damage they were doing and gently lead me away from them. But some days I fall back into those mindsets that I created while high (depressive episodes) even though I‚Äôve been sober for quite a while now. 

This next part is also long, so I‚Äôm sorry for the long read, but it‚Äôs not often that I find some sort of clarity after the episode that I can put it into words that resemble something that might make sense. 

Here‚Äôs what I wrote after an episode:

My mind is breaking. I can feel my sanity slipping away. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs real anymore. I feel like the whole universe is trying to tell me something that it can‚Äôt directly tell me. I feel like I‚Äôm living some crazy elaborate lie, and I don‚Äôt even know what the truth is anymore. I feel like I‚Äôm locked away parts of myself. So many parts that I‚Äôve created a fantastic labyrinth of self hatred and shame, that I can‚Äôt find my way out of it. Everything makes sense and nothing makes sense at the same time. I feel so lost in my mind. I just stood in front of the mirror for I don‚Äôt know how long, staring at my own face and I hallucinated an old man or maybe a monster staring back at me, dark and sad and shameful. It felt as if my soul had left my body and I was left with the unending shame of what I am and always will be, something sub human, something terrible and disgusting, something that felt like an inescapable truth. I didn‚Äôt take anything. I haven‚Äôt in a long time. I don‚Äôt know if I ever will take or smoke anything ever again at the chance that they have somehow caused what I am feeling now. I don‚Äôt know how to feel right now. I can only tell that ignoring this feeling and putting my mind elsewhere is only going to exacerbate the problem. There‚Äôs something deeply wrong with me.

em7rmt,Its my time,therapy,1578565113.0,32,79,"Hey, stranger on the internet that ill never meet.
My life is over and i wanted to share my story.
My name is Zachary and I‚Äôm 18. In my ‚Äúshort‚Äù life I‚Äôve endured more than i could ever imagine. 

Lets start from the beginning. 
The year is 2001, I was born into a family who didn‚Äôt want me used me as a slave. My father was a drug addict and dealer and my mother left when i was 3. She was also consumed by drugs and would rather pursue that over her kid.

From the time i was 4 until i turned 14 i was stuck going back and forth between my Dad and Grandmother. They would get protective orders against each-other and it resulted in us being moves from house to house. At 8 years old I was forced to work for my dad doing HVAC after school, sometimes not getting home until after midnight. That continued until I was 12, then i was forced to take over a paper route my step-mother no longer wanted. We lived in a 2 bedroom apartment and it consisted of Me, my sister, 3 younger brothers, step-mom, and my father. Every-night we crammed onto a couch just to sleep. 
Most days we didn‚Äôt have food because my father and step mom had drug problems. I had income from my paper route but it was taken from my father every week. We got aid from the state such as food stamps and wic but my parents would sell it for cash to buy drugs and clothes and whatever else they wanted.
The whole time we lived here I missed school. From 6th grade to 8th grade i went a total of 193 days.

December of 2013 our apartment burned down and we lost everything. During this time I got placed with my grandparents because my father stuck his dick in my ear an took pictures of it. My grandmother received the photos and had my father arrested. (He got out 2 days later and was never charged) 

Remember when i said i wasn‚Äôt going to school?
Yeah that caught up to me and i was sent away March 4 of 2014. I was placed in states custody for 90 days until the state could find a place to put me. During this time I succeeded in school getting the best grades ive ever had. Sadly thats where my good luck ran out. I was placed with my mother in June and it didn‚Äôt last long. I was kicked out of my house for getting addicted to drugs. I was home for 3 weeks before I started selling and doing Xanax. 

Fast forward to 2016. Im in high-school, but its my second almost third time being a freshman. I still wasn‚Äôt going to school. My mother rented an apartment but never stayed there. So i did. I would party and just generally destroy the apartment. Well eventually my mom quit paying the bills. So I got a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job at taco bell. In the 2 months that i worked there i got hooked on cocaine. I wasn‚Äôt going to school again and my manger knew, so she scheduled me more and more. Most days i worked night shift which was about 11 hours. Sometimes i would work open to close because we were short staffed. Coke fueled my ability to work. 

March,3rd 2017, i was sent to a psychiatric ward for a week from having panic attacks caused by my drug use. 

Fast forward again to October 31st, 2017. Im in court for truancy and guess what? I got sent away. By this time i was smoking crack, snorting anything i could get my hands on plus selling a-lot of stolen drugs from my dealer. Anyway Im on my way to placement for the second time. 

You want to know what scarred me the most? I had to take multiple drug test. You know why that scarred me? My family would finally see that i was just like them. I was trash. My mother got the report and it stated everything i failed for. Want the list? Here you go.

Herion
Cocaine 
Xanax 
Weed
MDMA
GHB
And my favorite: Ketamine 

During my time is placement i did really well i school once again. However i kept getting in trouble. Fighting other kids at the facility, staff and even a few visitors.
I got caught with a cellphone which is a big no no. I got the option to take my TASC test which is the GED Test in my state. I passed it in about 4 weeks and was allowed to go home. Problem was i had no home to go to. So i asked my dad if i could stay with him. Sounds dumb right? Yeah i know and it didn‚Äôt last long. We eventually got into a fist fight and long story short he beat my ass to a pulp. After this happened my best friend said ‚Äúhey you can move in with me‚Äù 

So, it march of 2018, I‚Äôm staying with my friend but i feel like a burden to his family. So i left. I moved in with my sister. And I‚Äôve lived with her ever since. Im starting to feel like a burden to her as well. Once i moved in with her i got my shit together and started working full-time. Doing? You guessed it HVAC. The thing that started all my issues has finally come back. 

Now cut to December of 2019. I got laid off due to ‚Äúlack of work‚Äù and my car broke down.  Current date is 1/9/20 and my car is still broke down and i still haven‚Äôt found a job. Its currently 5:14 am and I‚Äôm about to enjoy my last cigarette ever. 

I know people may never read this and that ok. Its more for me to come to peace with my self. If you took the to read this, thank you from the bottom of my heart because thats the first time anyone has ever cared enough about me to hear my story.

1gof66q,My friend died of a drug overdose today. How do I handle it?,therapy,1731284209.0,8,7,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm struggling with something really tough and could use some advice or maybe just some understanding from others who‚Äôve experienced something similar.

A close friend of mine recently passed away from a Percocet overdose. It's been really hard processing everything, and I'm still in shock. He and I had shared a lot over the years, but this loss feels like a heavy weight that‚Äôs hard to lift. He‚Äôd been struggling with addiction for a while, and while I knew things weren't looking great, I never imagined it would end this way.

Here‚Äôs the part that‚Äôs complicating everything even further: I recently discovered that he had left his will and testament in my Discord DMs. I‚Äôm not sure if it was meant for me specifically or if it was just the place he felt safe to put it, but now I have a huge responsibility. The will contains instructions for some personal matters, and it‚Äôs honestly overwhelming. I never expected something like this to fall into my lap. 

My question is: how do I handle this? Do I need to get legal help to make sure I‚Äôm doing things the right way? What should I even do with the contents of his will if I don‚Äôt have any official authority or legal standing? I don‚Äôt want to make any mistakes or dishonor his wishes, especially when emotions are still so raw. On top of that, I‚Äôm still grieving his loss and processing everything.

Has anyone else been in a situation where a friend passed away unexpectedly, and you ended up being the one with sensitive documents or wishes in your possession? How did you approach it? Any advice on handling both the emotional and legal aspects of this would be incredibly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.",overdose

On tuesday night I had drank about 3-4 shots of tito‚Äôs and I decided to go on facetime with some friends. I then took 90mg of a substance prescribed for ADHD and often taken by college kids. Then i took 75mg of a medication used for insomnia/severe anxiety this doesn‚Äôt produce a high but it makes you sleepy and i‚Äôve found it to amplify the effects of other substances (mixing a downer and an upper not good already). then about an hour went by and I decided to drink again so I went to the kitchen and drank about 4-5 shots of of an alcohol that sounds like daniels jack (mixing dark and light idk how i didn‚Äôt puke) at this point i‚Äôm extremely drunk but decided to snort some more of the ADHD medication. i have ADHD myself so it would take a lot for me to feel the effects but at this point i‚Äôm at 180mg which is 6x the highest dose prescribed for ADHD. This is where things got extremely bad. But I went to the kitchen and drank a few more shots of a third type of alcohol that i don‚Äôt know what it was but it was strong. I was still on facetime with about 5 people the whole night with a few people coming in and out. 

I completely blacked out from 2-5am which was scary because my friends have been saying it really bad. I found two 7 minute screen recordings in my camera roll of me on facetime and using my phone, I don‚Äôt think I knew i was screen recording. At one point in the recordings I couldn‚Äôt sit up, and a bit later in it my eyes were racing and fluttering. My friends say they thought i was going to OD and watching that I think I may have. All day yesterday I was extremely tired as i got about 10 minutes of sleep but could not sleep. I have had a consistent headache since yesterday as well as severe nausea that got somewhat better today. Yesterday my face looked weird to me almost as if my facial features were all slightly different same with my body. But today that is slightly better. 

I feel like I should tell my mom but I know I would get admitted to the mental hospital and my parents would never trust me again. And i know everyone would think of me differently.  My other friend was also doing some other substances as well as some alcohol and she ended up telling her mom because it got too bad and now she was admitted to the ward. and I think I would be in the same boat if I snitch on myself but my health needs to come first so I don‚Äôt know what to do.

its so exhausting. my body feels so heavy after. my chest will hurt sometimes. my arms will hurt sometimes after. my head will hurt sometimes. ill wake up screaming or sobbing or gasping for air or whimpering or thrashing around.


the dreams are awful. i get stuck in them. they are so vivid. i dream constantly. every single night. they are always so complex. 


i can't live like this. but i always have. even as a little little kid. some of my earliest memories are reoccuring nightmares i had back then.


when im not having nightmares (i joke that i have nightmares seasons because of the way it comes in waves), i have wild dreams that are fine i guess but it is really tiresome. its exhausting to alwaysss have lived in some mini different world to wake up to this one. no breaks. always something going on. 


i barely sleep. i wake up frequently. its hard to fall asleep and hard to go back to sleep when i wake up. on top of that and the nightmares and constant dreaming period, i have sleep apnea. i stop breathing ofen in my sleep. 


i got a cpap about 1.5 years ago. at first it helped sorta mute my dreams. i still dreamed but it made it notably easier to forget my dreams in the waking hours. but in the past 4ish months, thats not the case. its like the old days. ive tried to see if maybe my cpap isnt working properly but it is. its working just as it should.


and i am ***TERRIFIED*** of sleep meds. ive seen how badly it messed mom up. and i knew a girl who died after taking some sleeping meds and she wasn't even trying to do anything crazy but sleep. ive always been scared of meds (i overdosed accidentally as a kid and almost died). but sleeping meds??? ahhhh f that.


the first time i finally tried melatonin, i was up till 5 in the morning because i was so scared. ive since used it some and it helps me fall asleep but ill wake up about 3ish hours later usually.


ive tried smoking weed and it doesnt seem to make any significant change and ive tried gummies (tho i hate edibles) and tried different strans of weed and there was a notice in being able to fall asleep but not much change in dreams. 


i feel so hopless. sometimes im really angry about it and feel like no one knows what i go through. no one knows how impressive it is that i carry on in my day to day.


one time, i had never been so isolated in my life. for about 2 years, i had just moved into a new state (for school). i was so incredibly alone. i stopped talking mostly out of having no one to talk to. i was deeeep in my eating disorder tho and nothing else mattered. i did school work, slept, body checked, threw up, chewed and spit food, spent a LOT of energy on figuring out what i was ""allowed"" to eat and calculating calories, ect. it didnt matter i had no one, because i was ""winning"" and ""ana"" was my company. 


then things got a tiny bit better as i had a break down a year in, i started loosing hair, ect. i started trying to eat a meal a day. ect. then i went through a month of non stop nightmares. horrible terrifying gruesome nightmares. waking up screaming sweating shaking and more. almost like clockwork, id force myself to stay awake for as long as possible, usually about 24 hours, then my body would force sleep and like clockwork, id wake up 2 hours later in various distressing states. and id force myself to stay awake again, then 24 hours would pass... the cycle began. this was during covid times. i didnt leave my place. i lived alone. i lived off rice and eggs. for a month and then i had a black out of which stuff was moved around my place but i had absolutely zero memory of the last 8 or so hours and ""came to"" looking out a window. 


i decided to get therapy then. it wasnt great since i didnt really have resources. the school provided a therapist. but her and i focused heavily on my eating disorder.


these nightmares and my dreaming will never end tho.. and idk how much i can take having to live like this. 


i was sexually abused throughout my childhood. my mom is mentally ill with an extreme eating disorder. both mom and dad are alcoholics. i was bullied severely.


im thankfully in a safe environment mostly now. i work a sketchy job tho. i have the most most wonderful partner. im just... this thing. it disrupts my world. how am i even living each day? im so tired and im so scared to sleep. ",overdose

I spent from ages 4 to 7 with my dad living in my aunts house I loved that place but my dad was never around he had graveyard so I'd be asleep he'd be home I was awake he'd be working my aunts took care of me. One day when I was 7 my aunt was driving me home from school we got home saw my grandparents car and walked in. I still remember that day so clearly my aunt B yelling at my dad ""how can you take my baby girl away"" my dad telling ""shes my kid you've kept me from raising her for long enough."" My dad took me to my grandparents house. I spent that day crying I never felt at peace at my grandparents house now it was my home. I started going to therapy I started getting bullied for crying too much. My grandma is very good at lying and started convincing me that my dad was touching me inappropriately. My dad lost custody when I was 11 he never had jail time because there was no proof of abuse I don't think there was any abuse thinking back
I started sneaking out at night I started drinking I spent most of my middle days drunk. My grandma didn't care about me or my papa we were both her source of income she has a hoarding habit we were her funds. I started cutting in 8th grade and developed anorexia. My aunts basically encouraged my weight loss every time I lost weight id get new pretty clothes and cool items. 
Going into 9th grade high school I really didnt know what love was I knew I wanted something like what I had seen on hallmark movies. I met this boy well multiple boys but the one that was my boyfriend showered me with love until he cheated on me with my entire friend group. I started using meth I had already met shitty people during my going outside at night to drink. I became a prostitute at age 14. I started dating an older guy at my high school and ended up pregnant when I told him he said get an abortion I told him no. He ended up having a football player push me down belly first and I miscarried. 
I had already started going to a youth center and through them I signed myself up for rehab. I still remember being excited to get away from my family 6 months in an all girl lockdown rehab seemed like a nice idea. I went hugged my family goodbye and I didn't see the sun in 6 months. 
I did get clean and sober but at the cost of my longterm freedom. 
My family for the next 5 years so when I was 19 had me on permanent almost house arrest. I wasn't allowed friends or to go outside unsupervised. I missed out on getting jobs when it was okay to not have experience. I ended up running into an old friend at Walmart one day we met up and started a relationship
Jake was a nice guy so I thought I told him everything how my family treated me how I wish I could leave this world behind. He had me move in with him pretty soon we started fighting. He didn't do constructive criticism well and he cared more about what his buddies thought and hanging out with them than me. Things started getting violent he cut my arm burnt me with a cigarette and tried to stab me in my privates with a knife. I kept leaving him and going back I did that for an entire year. 
During that year my papa fell ill my grandma hated me I had another miscarriage and I was back and forth with Jake. Eventually I ended leaving him bit we were and still are friends. Yah ik what your thinking how could you stay friends with your abuser well besides the abuse Jake was when we weren't dating a huge part of my support group it's weird together we're toxic apart we become each other's best allies. 
Sadly when I was with Jake I got addicted to cigarettes and started drinking again and so as my 21st birthday was coming closer I decided I should get a under the table job for money to be able to have a party and to fund my smoking habit. 
I ended up taking a nanny job for some childhood family acquaintances. I had been couch hopping since I got with Jake and hearing that I would be making $600 a month I decided to live in a clean and sober house for $350 a month. I was unaware that the mom who was supposed to pay me had been spending her husband's money left and right and had no job. As my rent due date came closer I knew I couldn't pay it I called the mom crying and she and her husband let me move in.
It was around this time I started seeing my now boyfriend. He was a childhood friend I fell fast and he moved in with me to help me nanny the three kids. He was supposed to get on ssi for his mental disabilities he had been unfairly cut off and was reapplying. Most of the dreams I had to be a mom and a wife suddenly seemed possible I could work have a husband at home to take care of house and kids. Well months past the kids and their parents got meaner and meaner til eventually we left after I was kicked in the head by their eldest child.
Since that day my boyfriend and I have been hopping around one bad roommate situation after another me failing to get work his ssi not coming. About a month ago we left my home town to live with his mom several cities away. I've been homesick and Jake recently got into meth and overdosed, many of my friends aren't putting in effort to stay in touch.
During our couch hopping my boyfriend promised money from his ssi to people and he has promised about $1""700 worth of ssi money to people. 
My boyfriend just got denied for ssi and his mom can't afford next months rent on her own. I got a job but boyfriend isn't even looking. I have insomnia in fact it's 6am and I start work at 8am I haven't slept. I have so much anxiety knowing my income is the difference between under a roof or on the streets and my boyfriend can't possibly pay off the debts now. 
I'm becoming depressed resentful and bitter towards my boyfriend and wish I could redo my past. I have misaphonia and ptsd I'm under so much stress I'm having stomach and chest constantly. Every Dat is ridden with anxiety and I can feel my brain shutting off. I'm not usually a ""dumb"" person but recently I can barely operate.

My partner is my best friend and my soul mate - so I'm not divorcing the crazy b!tch! We deserve each other. I just need a to figure out how to deal with some of the slightly more insane issues she has (my own insane behavior will definitely be on the table for discussion in other conversations - I'm not trying to imply that I am a shining paragon of virtue here). I know that one of the first rules of therapy is that you can't change someone else - you can only change how you respond to them so, although I may get her into therapy at some point, what I'm looking for with this post are ways for me to cope or discussions I can have with her. 

Grab a coffee - I'll wait... You'll need some caffeine. 

Some backstory (you can skip it but there's some juicy/salient stuff here):
S and I have known each other more than 25 years. I met S when she began going out with and then moved in with my friend M (we were all in our mid-to-late 20s then). I think she was with him for four or five years. I was not really friends with S - M introduced me to her and we went out a few times as a group but S and I never gelled. When M was 31 years old, he passed away very suddenly. After the funeral, S and I lost touch. About a year later, I got in touch with S just to spend some time with someone who remembered M. I hadn't really liked her all that much but I missed M and we didn't share a friend group so I kind of settled. This sounds really horrible but S knows this and it really did work out for the best. Because I didn't like S, something significant happened. I'm a serious people pleaser - like REALLY bad! I mean, I'll be getting therapy for THAT (honestIy, you cannot imagine...). But because I didn't actually like S at the beginning, I didn't care enough to pretend to be someone else (which is generally what I do). This means that I inadvertantly let her get to know me better then my family, my other friends (way better than M ever did), anyone. I also got to know her and realized that what I had initially perceived as complete b!tchiniess  was actually a deep, dark irony which I quite liked. Then  she got on antidepressants and I saw the person under this cloud of depression that had overtaken her personality, and I grew to like her a lot. We went from friends to best friends to life partners. 

Unfortunately, as the years passed, I learned some other stuff about her which I first ignored and then... Well...I guess that's where therapy begins.

End of backstory

About three or four years after M died and I'd started spending time with S, she told me that she had told the people she worked with that M was her husband (she knew I would be meeting them). She said that it was just easier to explain her grief by saying they were married and she considered him her husband. I guess I was little weirded out but I just sort've decided I wasn't the one to judge I guess? and so I let it go.

Years later, after we were married, a friend from S's workplace was over. I said something about M's overdose (the cause of his death) and he told me he thought that M had died in an accident with their toddler. (!!!) After he left, I asked S if she had told people that and she said she ""might have"". Now I was totally freaked out by this but talk about having no idea what to say... I had NO IDEA WHAT TO SAY, I filed it for later  and figured I'd come back to it. I just keep letting it go. I've ignored it for 15 years now. 

Here we are, almost 20 years later. Her lies, for the most part are not so big anymore (well, at least not that I'm aware of or maybe just not the ones I know about). They haven't stopped  but they've changed. And now our life is necessarily a part of them. 

She has a chronic condition (which is completely valid) and she has to file some claims. This week she has told various people that she submitted the forms (she hasn't), she's talked to a lawyer (she hasn't), and a whole litany of ""facts"" based on research that she obviously hasn't done because the facts are wrong. All of these things were said in conversations that I was a part of. 

Someone broke into our house and she has told people different stories about what they took, how much our insurance will cover, and what the police said and did. I'm afraid to talk about it at all because I'm not sure if I remember the actual facts! (The actual facts are that someone broke in, and left without taking anything because we called the police. The person got away and, in reality, it was very boring. There will not be a Law & Order about it!) 

We were supposed to go out with friends the other night but I didn't feel up to it. Instead of texting them and letting them know I wasn't up to it (which is what I asked her to do), I overheard her von the phine spinning a tale of intrigue about a sick niece, expired car insurance and a need for us to go into the city early the next day for something or other. 

We were recently on vacation  at our condo which we rented but I heard her tell a random stranger in the pool that it was given to us by our uncle. Just why??? 

The problem is that I find myself either being oompicit and backing her up or being weirdly silent as her partner and someone who SHOULD be part of the conversation.

I love her and our life. I'd like to tell you that if y'all tell me to out her to my friends, that I would do that but I know me - if you make the most brilliant, irrefutable arguments for it, I still won't be able to do it. I can speak to HER honestly but pretty much no one else.

My two biggest concerns here are in regards to me.
1. I'm uncomfortable feeling like I have to support the lies but I can't call her out - I'm not capable. Do I just sit in awkward silence? Walk away? 
2. I don't trust her as much as I wish I could. She's told me that she was raped and molested when she was young. Are those more lies? Are they the cause of the lies now? It doesn't matter to me whether those specific things are true - they're in the past. How do i know what to believe TODAY? ",overdose

1crtc07,How do I stop my empathy from destroying me?,therapy,1715696375.0,4,4,"My empathy has ruined my life

The ability to see the worst traits in people and look past them. Im an insightful person. For lack of better words I see people as children. Hurt, stinging children. To see their most unexplained fears and feel them in my chest. To see their desires and what selfish reason compels them to want it. To see people‚Äôs worst behaviours and see what pain is causing them to act that way. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I see the manipulation, I see the awful behaviour, the greed, the calculation, but I CHOOSE to look past them. All because of my empathy. 

Many behaviours I‚Äôve experienced towards me would be enough to label the offender as a bad person and let go. But not me. I analyse. I learn. I listen. I immerse myself in them. I see the child inside them that‚Äôs tugging the strings, playing the cards. I see exactly why they are like this. Because of this, when treated poorly my inner child stings but I push past it quickly and instead I feel pain for them. I can literally channel their thought process and see how their brain developed to always protect, manipulate, deflect, calculate etc. and because of that I understand. I forgive. I never forget how they made me feel but I remember the child in their eyes. The child that was forced to learn these ways to survive in this world. 

But through it all, I am destroying my inner child. I am allowing people to kick her when she‚Äôs down, just to console them. I am letting people punch her as I bandage their knuckles. I have betrayed her. It‚Äôs the route of my self hatred, my self destruction. It‚Äôs because that little girl inside me really hates me for what I‚Äôve done to her. I can see her eyes well up with tears and feel the ache in her chest, the throb in her head. But I can‚Äôt save her because my heart is set on saving everyone else. She‚Äôs begging, screaming, pleading. But I can‚Äôt. She‚Äôs the only one I can‚Äôt save.

I was wondering why it is that after therapy sessions I just feel so ‚Ä¶ awful? Like I‚Äôve been on break and although it was super tough in the beginning to adapt to no therapy, I eventually got the hang of it and of not feeling stuff. This doesn‚Äôt negate the fact that I had been waiting impatiently for the break to end and to have therapy again. But now that I do, it just feels like I‚Äôm struggling again. I just feel so sad and depressed afterwards, for the whole week. I don‚Äôt want to do anything or see anyone, I just don‚Äôt wanna be here (except for therapy). All I look forward to is that session and that‚Äôs it. The whole world and the idea of life and living just becomes so much more darker and undesirable in my eyes. When I was on break, however, things were just neutral after that first rough week. I was kinda ‚Äúokay‚Äù and just didn‚Äôt feel all this darkness and sadness. This relationship I have with therapy feels almost like an addiction and withdrawal type of thing? Like I always want it and need it but when it‚Äôs over I go through withdrawal and can‚Äôt wait until the next time I get it.

I don‚Äôt get why this happens or what‚Äôs going on. Is therapy supposed to make you feel like this? Or is it just a phase (even though I‚Äôve been in therapy for about three years) that will pass eventually? What do I do about it? Can anyone relate? ",withdrawal

I was prescribed 10mg of Escitalopram after being diagnosed with health anxiety and panic attacks note that I'm only 18 .

 At first i was nervous taking one then i somehow took the first dose at the morning i did get the side effects right away like being dry mouthed and bodily ache , the other day I didn't take any and went to the doctor .

He brushed it off by saying the aches were due to my poor posture but he did agreed on dry mouthed being an¬†anxiety¬†symptoms so then i started to take it again took it for 3 straight days and tapered because i was busy and forgot to take the med . 

i then experienced other known side effects like brain zaps and jolts which lasted for a week , went to the doctor and he told me to not withdraw it and take it with a flow (like every day) i then took it for 3 more days after which then i realized this tablet was not for me it made me feel dizzy , weird and restless like which i didn't had any before when i was not the medication .

I made a decision of not taking it anymore no matter how depressed or stressed i am .As the day passed my withdrawal symptoms started to go away i kinda felt relaxed little did i know about the next morning 

When i woke up i had that buzzing vibrating feeling in my body especially head it was hard to describe like it was not on the outside but rather i could feel it in the inside  it lasted for few hours and then went away , i had it for three days straight and i was annoyed i couldn't figure it as was causing it 

 the 3rd day when i got the tremor/buzzing sensation i decided to take the escitalopram again .It made me super drowsy that day and i was all sleepy 

But the Suprize was the next day i didn't feel any of the tremors and shakiness and i thought it went away i didn't take any escitalopram and continued my day the passed and boom the next day  ! the tremors came again and its been three more days and they are still bothering me 

it feels like my body is deseprate for a dose 

.i went to a neuro physician he recommended me Librex and Pronalenol a beta blocker and told me to not be scared  i didn't take it as i was afraid of the side effects

So my concern is that i don't want to take any kind of Anti depressant again in my whole life as my experience has been the worst with them and have left me feeling miserable but i do want to end the tremor and buzzing feeling as well but without taking The escitalopram again .

Can you guys give me any hope of them getting away any time soon or should i freak out because if they are permanent and  i might not live normal again . Any advice would be appreciated I'd be waiting for your reply.",withdrawal
lw9wtb,At what point do I medically withdraw from this class?,therapy,1614712076.0,3,7,"Edit: I just withdrew from class. Almost every single class she did this thing where she would lie to us (or tell... half-truths) and then get mad at us when we tried to clarify what was going on. She hasn't really taught a single lecture, I've learned nothing b/c so much is video. She stated that she was handing out the midterm this week, and I knew there would be no way I'd be able to catch up, write the essay, do the midterm, AND deal with my four other classes.

Fortunately, I always try to take five classes a semester so I can drop one and still be full-time. I was stressed out at first because I was afraid a withdraw on my transcript would look bad when applying for phds, but I realized that was not worth my mental health. 

**TL;DR: I'm a disabled student that needs subtitles. The professor wants me to catch up on 5 weeks of videos + recorded lectures that were not provided by Friday. I need to withdraw, but I'm scared and don't know if I even can.**

I'm having issues with a professor of mine. *Lots* of issues, most are little things that are adding up. But the worst part is that I need subtitles + audio on videos, and the majority of class (like, 45-60 minutes of a 75-minute class) is her showing videos w/o subtitles (and sometimes w/o audio) via Zoom. It's *literally* in my disability paperwork that I need subtitles or I need to be given the opportunity to re-watch outside of class.

I was getting really nervous because we have a paper due tonight at midnight. I have zero material, I've learned nothing in this class. I have no materials. I'm upset because we're now in week 6 of the semester and the professor doesn't really seem to have a plan.

I got in contact with the head of the department, who contacted the disability department. My disability coordinator talked to the professor. The professor finally emailed me.

She's giving me until Friday at *noon* to catch up and get the essay done. That's 2 days - I have class all day Thursday (four of my five classes are Tuesday + Thursday) and literally have 0 time to do anything that day. She also said the videos are all on Blackboard. We've been telling her for weeks that her recorded lectures are not on Blackboard and the videos aren't showing up either. Even if they were, five weeks is approximately 5-8 hours of videos (rough estimate) and then another ten hours of lecture. I physically *can't* catch up on Friday, even if I only study for this class. I also have work for my ***four*** other classes that need to get done.

Even then, it's absolutely ridiculous for me to show up to class 2x/week, watch these videos, then spend another couple hours outside of class re-watching them.

I emailed my advisor to set up a meeting so we can discuss withdrawing. I can't handle it. I've been thinking it through, I don't know if I can make it through the semester with this class. I'm too far behind at this point. But I'm nervous. The chair of the department was really encouraging me to stick through it, and I feel like I'd be letting her down.",withdrawal
nezf2r,I need help escaping trauma bond and toxic friendships (withdrawal is hurting so much),therapy,1621306685.0,1,1,"I got out of a very toxic relationship by a narcissistic abuser that emotionally pained me for years. However, I've had intense cravings of attachment for them, and wanting them and for a while I thought I'm just crazy but really I've been experiencing symptoms of trauma bond. My dad's a very verbally abusive and narcissistic person to my family and I don't know what it's like to have a real dad or feel emotionally close to one. When I was 10, my dad started trying to manipulate me into hating my mom, by feeding me with lies and talking bad about her to me everytime I got into a fight with her. Those fights were just general ones where my mom and I have minor disputes that turn into arguments. Yet my dad steps in and then pulls me to say lies about my mom so I can hate her. He's done this because he manipulated her into buying or doing things before they're married all that, and he's mad she refuses to. My manipulation at a young age led me to form attachment to manipulating people. I fell in love with a manipulator, and my strong attachment with him because he shares the same qualities as my dad unconsciously drove me to my the boy. It turned to a point where I'd do anything he'd ask me to do, I changed myself, I acted different, I was isolated from my friends, I lost so many people, and what hurts most is after I realized I was trauma bonded to him, the amount of people that knew I was bonded had always gotten annoyed with me and yelled at me when I told them I'm suffering. It hurts more when I realized who else was toxic in my life, and how much I give. I remember a friend that I looked up to made me cry and I still tried talking to them because I'm so hung up on the past and how I was their best friend. Another problem I have is get hung up on so many toxic friends that change worse. Now that I'm cutting contact with my toxic people, it really hurts because I feel almost like I'm going to die. I feel so pained because my brain has been living a fantasy, and coming out of a dream where I thought everyone who was toxic was loving, it's so much pain I feel terrible.

I find his emotional withdrawal in these situations horrible. I hate it because it feels like he is shutting down any opportunity for us to talk in a manner that is constructive and helpful. 

He says he feels it deep in his body. It sounds like nails on a blackboard when we speak and he panics and can't communicate effectively at all. 

It's quite likely he is somewhere along the autism spectrum and possibly suffering from some kind of CPTSD. 

Obviously he has some serious issues he needs to address. Honestly that's on him, I can't do it for him. He needs therapy. Which is the plan. 

I really need some resources on emotional withholding. I am so not okay with it at all. I don't mind if the need for space is communicated and the conversation will be revisted later but once he has crossed a line he is cold, argumentative and unkind. 

He is up for reading but I need to find some things for him to read.

1if1gt3,My counselor argued with me about my anxiety.,therapy,1738396179.0,15,6,"
During today‚Äôs therapy session, I shared my concerns, thinking it was a safe space. I applied for a job and had to answer whether I had a disability. I said no, even though I‚Äôm bipolar II (which I‚Äôve made significant progress with). I explained that I was afraid the company would withdraw my offer if I disclosed my mental illness. Given the nature of the job, I feel it‚Äôs crucial to share my experience with mental illness, but I was scared of the repercussions.
That‚Äôs when things went south. I also mentioned my anxiety around the Trump administration‚Äôs impact on DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives, and he immediately started telling me that DEI doesn‚Äôt work and that applying for a job is different from that. He continued to argue with me about why DEI doesn‚Äôt work and how discrimination and prejudice will always be present, dominating the rest of our session. Since we went a little over time, he essentially ended the session while I was still talking (though I don‚Äôt blame him for that).

What truly upset me was when he told me that if I really wanted the job, I shouldn‚Äôt have lied about my disability. He then ranted about DEI, completely shifting the focus away from my concerns. I understand he has his opinions, and I respect that, but he completely lost track of the issue I came to him with. At the end of the session, he made me feel as though I had been distracted from the topic.

To defend myself against the anxiety, I want to point out that from all the job applications I submitted, the only companies that called me back for interviews were the ones I didn‚Äôt disclose my disability to.

As someone who envisions a career in mental health, I felt frustrated and ashamed about my decision to become a licensed counselor. I‚Äôm definitely planning to change therapists, but I can‚Äôt help but wonder if I should‚Äôve avoided getting into that conversation in the first place. Maybe it‚Äôs my fault.

1hn6vx9,Holding Space for Intellectual Honesty and Accountability in Therapy,therapy,1735273787.0,19,5,"(Disclaimer: The following critique is not necessarily a manifestation of unresolved childhood issues, resistance to authority, fear of vulnerability, or intellectualization as a defense mechanism.)


In my search for a new therapist, I contacted many local practitioners. During many of these phone calls and email exchanges, I noticed a pattern of defensiveness and deflection when I asked certain questions about therapy. These interactions suggest a pervasive cultural issue within the profession.


A particularly troubling example arises when prospective clients raise concerns about competencies such as memory and conversational continuity between sessions:

""I'm concerned about continuity between sessions. In my current therapy, I sometimes need to re-explain important themes, narratives, or significant events I've already discussed. I don't expect perfect recall, but it's important that major themes and events are tracked. How do you handle continuity and recall?""

The response I've encountered far too often - so often it seems to be part of their training:

**""I wonder why you're so bothered by people forgetting things. Did you feel unheard by adults when you were a child?""**

This response is troubling for several reasons:

Intellectually Dishonest: It evades answering a valid question

Patronizing: It implies clients can't distinguish between personal history and reasonable professional expectations

Manipulative: It uses therapeutic language to deflect accountability

Gaslighting: It converts appropriate expectations into symptoms of dysfunction

For professionals charging premium rates ($200+)  such deflection is egregious.

This pattern also extends to broader inquiries about the practice of therapy itself. For instance, when I asked about the inherent tensions between maintaining a therapeutic frame and encouraging authentic engagement, I even heard a few responses along these lines:
""I'm wondering if you've struggled with structured relationships before. And how did your family handle emotional expression?""

This type of response turns a thoughtful question into a projection of personal dysfunction. It dismisses client curiosity about the therapeutic process as evidence of pathology, creating an unfalsifiable dynamic: any effort to analyze or question is framed as avoidance.

The Problem with Oversimplification

When clients demonstrate intellectual engagement with therapy, therapists too often reduce this complexity to binary interpretations:
""You're avoiding.‚Äù
""This is intellectualization.""
""Your need to understand therapy is preventing you from experiencing it.‚Äù

These reductive responses stand in stark contrast to the complexity therapists are trained to navigate:
Therapists are educated in nuanced psychological theories
They hold advanced degrees requiring understanding of therapeutic modalities
Their training emphasizes the interconnectedness of thought and emotion.

Yet, when confronted with intellectually engaged clients who challenge their frameworks, therapists often retreat into simplistic either/or thinking, creating troubling power dynamics:

Intellectual Dominance

When a thoughtful question about therapeutic structure gets reframed as personal pathology, therapists claim the authority to redefine inquiries as resistance. This positions the therapist as the sole arbiter of what constitutes valid discourse.

Circular Control
Any critique of therapy's power dynamics can be labeled as resistance or issues with authority, creating an impossible bind for clients who engage critically. They must either suppress their curiosity or risk being pathologized for expressing it.

Implications for the Profession

These defensive patterns have consequences, both for individual therapeutic relationships and for the profession as a whole. This is compounded by the broader therapeutic discourse, particularly in online communities and forums where therapists feel comfortable speaking more candidly. In these spaces, where anonymity fosters more open exchanges, I've observed a dismayingly high percentage of dismissive attitudes and resistance to accountability being reinforced and validated by peers. (""Hey, don't worry about it, sometimes all you need to do is show up, occasionally express empathy,  then let them do their thing. They probably won't even notice."") This suggests a systemic issue that extends beyond individual therapists. 

This raises some ideas for therapists to consider:

1. A Gap in Accountability 
Deflecting basic questions about continuity, structure, or professional competencies raises concerns about the profession's willingness to hold itself to high standards. When therapists respond to substantive questions with psychological reframing, it erodes trust and creates a sense of insecurity in the therapeutic relationship.

2. Cost of Avoiding Complexity
Therapy should embrace clients who think critically while feeling deeply, including those who examine the therapeutic process itself. When this natural curiosity is dismissed as resistance, clients learn to suppress their insights, creating exactly the kind of superficial engagement therapy aims to transcend.

3. Power Imbalances
Defensiveness reinforces unhealthy power dynamics, undermining the collaborative nature therapy strives to cultivate. Clients who feel dismissed or misunderstood may withdraw from meaningful engagement, limiting the potential for authentic therapeutic work.

How Therapy Can Improve

1. Acknowledge Paradoxes
Accept that some clients can benefit from therapy while also critiquing its structures
Recognize that meta-awareness of therapy is often a sign of engagement, not avoidance

2. Elevate Professional Discourse
Engage with client observations at the intellectual level they're offered
Stop labeling analytical thinking as resistance
Demonstrate the critical thinking skills expected of advanced degrees

3. Examine Power Dynamics
Recognize how defensiveness perpetuates unhealthy hierarchies
Avoid using therapeutic interpretations to shield against accountability
Address critiques with openness, not dismissal

4. Create Real Accountability
Establish standards for competencies like memory and continuity
Address client concerns with direct, honest responses instead of psychological reframing

Final Thought

We cannot grow without examining our blind spots. Therapy, as a profession, should not be above this principle.

They‚Äôve communicated that they need space sometimes, and I try not to take it personally. But the inconsistency leaves me feeling stuck‚Äîlike I‚Äôm constantly waiting to feel chosen again.

I‚Äôve been seeing the same therapist for just over a year now. I initially fell in love with her because we clicked so well! It was like I was talking to a friend who knew my way of thinking. But from the start, she would talk about this man she knew and what their friendship was like (without getting into too much detail, it is a friendship/secret relationship that has also willingly become a professional relationship). At first I didn‚Äôt mind it too much. It was like we were friends, so I was cool with it. But now it‚Äôs to the point where she brings him, and their ‚Äúsituation‚Äù up all the time.

Because all I want to do is scream at her to wake up that it‚Äôs never going to happen with him and she needs to realize that and cut ties with this man. But I feel like it‚Äôs not my place. 

Is there anything I can do?

Everything you say to a therapist is confidential unless there is a risk of seriously hurting yourself, someone else or suspected/proof of child abuse.

When people talk about hurting themselves, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they break confidentiality and zip you of to hospital.

They want to assess your safety.  Hospitals should always be an absolute last resort.  This means asking you questions like - how common are your thoughts of suicide? Do you have a plan of hurting yourself - when/where/how?  What‚Äôs stopped you so far? What other support or coping skills do you have?

It is really common to have suicidal thoughts but not have any active thoughts or plans.  Therapists just want to help the best way that they can.

It‚Äôs ok to talk to your therapist. It can be really scary but you‚Äôre not alone.

1g9pfyx,TW!! how do I tell my therapist I have a plan for ending my life?,therapy,1729622133.0,14,1,"today I (14f) told my school therapist I didn't want to be here anymore. we sat in silence for a while before she asked if I had a plan but I didn't answer her. I was far too scared to answer in fear of my parents finding out or even being hospitalised. my parent's are aware to an extent but they have no clue I have a plan and have thoughts daily.
my therapist never asked me how often I have thoughts either as I think she could tell I was scared to talk about it. I've read from multiple sources that she is supposed to ask questions like that and ask if I have a plan and get an answer out of me, but I think no answer WAS an answer. do I tell her and how??",end my life

lhc0zd,I bombed an interview because I've been alone my entire life and recently realized this due to therapy that I don't want to continue. Long story. I am at the end of my metaphorical rope.,therapy,1613014819.0,26,76,"I was on track to get a job at a place I love and the only thing that was left was to formalize everything via a video interview. I had a choice between reading from a deck of cards to avoid going overboard or giving wrong answers... and trusting myself since I'd practiced everything for 6 weeks up until that point. I decided at the last minute the deck of cards would sound mechanical and unnatural so I tried to go natural... what a mistake.

It was a huge mistake. I overdid it by a long shot and said things that really didn't portray me in the best light. I almost ranted. I know it's because I have been alone for too long. The pandemic made my already bad mental health situation a lot worse. But that's not really an excuse for how badly I bombed this. I could tell they were reevaluating how good a fit I really was and who can blame them. I could see it on their faces.

I talked too much because I have barely spoken to any other human being in almost a year now, and before then I wasn't socializing because I was in therapy twice a week and couldn't handle talking to people at all.

Now... I talk to myself randomly during the day... I rant at the walls thinking of people from my past. (Yes... I know how bad this is. It's getting worse.)

I work from home. I bet if my neighbors could hear me they'd think I've gone batshit, because I have.

I know why I did this, why this is happening. I can't stop it though. Everything wrong with my life is in front of me, like cards strewn across a table, because I'd been in therapy for 2 years nonstop every week and it was too much stuff dug up all at once, when I have zero support to deal with it. I've never had support. Once the therapy appointment was over, I was all by myself.

I did this to myself... I thought I could handle it, I thought if I could just get through it things would get better. Well... I can't, and I have no one to help me, and it's frankly too late since I'm already gone off the deep end.

I have a really messed-up life, a horrible people picker, I got myself into bad situations because I didn't know any better... I wrack my brain trying to figure out where I could have done better and I'd have needed a lot of luck I didn't have. I really did what I could... but man, objectively I am an example of someone who should have been able to be so much better. Or maybe my circumstances were really that fucked up? But it takes ages to explain the whole thing. Am I not just making up fucking excuses? I understand why the people who fucked me up did so. But what does it matter?

I've seriously hurt people along the way as a result because I didn't get to have good role models as a kid and was constantly redirected back to my possessive mother when I tried to find inspiration elsewhere than my abusive parents. This left me around people who just abused me, I picked the same kind of people after I became an adult... I understand the process, the cycle of violence, attachment issues... But essentially I've been alone, unsupported for most of my life because I wasn't who my parents wanted me to be, then because I was critical I was a bully; I was bullied myself, quickly became too depressed to be appreciated as a teenager, I tried to do EVERYTHING by myself after that because I needed to be perfect to be loved and I was always alone anyway.... I supported people who didn't support me, I burnt out for jobs that didn't support me. I chose the worst boyfriends and tolerated all of their crappy, abusive, immature and weak behavior because I thought it was my job as a woman to do that.

Last few years everything came to a head and I finally noticed how alone I really have been for 40 years. Since I was a baby, I was a bother, I wasn't the perfect little child one parent wanted and I was despised for existing by the other.

I've never had anyone I could tell this whole picture to. That's pathetic in itself. The story is equally pathetic. I'm 40 years old and dead inside because I was never loved. I should have been able to just get over it, as if I'm the only one in this situation in the world, as if I somehow deserved a better outcome ""just because we should all be loved""... nah I'd have to basically let myself get exploited to be worth loving at this point. I just know it. I grew a spine, for what? To continue being alone. I got away from an abusive ex for what? It was a shit choice either way, stay with him and be alone around him, or be actually literally alone.

Realizing this, integrating it... It's absolutely devastating me. I have managed to hold it together at work for the last 2 years... until now.

I **had** a job. It was in the bag. I bombed it because I CANNOT LIVE AND KEEP BEING THIS ALONE. I just cried in the shower for half an hour because I have NEVER had anyone to give me even a fucking hug and offer some encouragement at an interview. What I got was always criticism or disinterest. I could have used a hug from someone who'd have loved me despite being a poor performer. I have never had that. I've loved people who really didn't love me, they loved all the crap I could do for them. It hurts. I never will have that. I'd have to bend over backwards in ways I know are just not healthy. Because I have nothing to offer but a broken person, and that's honey to fucking predators.

And because I've done the work and taken notice and finally came to terms with this... I am punished by it. I can't stuff all of this crap back inside anymore, it has to be dealt with.

IT COST ME MY EMPLOYMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. Being told ""Sorry... after all we're going to go with the other strong candidate we got. I hope you understand."" Yeah, you bet I do. I wouldn't hire me after that if the roles were reversed.

And I'm still alone having to deal with the aftermath of this. Like usual. Going to cry myself to sleep *again* for another reason and having to figure out how to deal with a whole new set of people in a potentially abusive work environment....... hah there's a silver lining there. I'm used to THAT. I'll just go back to who I was when I was being abused! I'll ""survive"" that way. For sure. I'll just resign myself to being abused. That's where life always seems to shove me and I can't do a damn thing about it anymore.

I can't imagine ever having a relationship where I don't have to debase myself or be exploited to be liked. I am completely broken. Years of therapy to... learn how to live alone? I don't want that. I really don't. But that's all I can have. It's the only realistic outcome.

I can't deal with any of this anymore. I couldn't keep it together for a fucking interview. THE EXACT TIME I NEEDED TO KEEP IT TOGETHER MOST.

I don't think I can keep it together at all after this. I'm just going to let myself get fat, and uglier and uglier so I at least don't attract any assholes, or I can know the guys who go for me are full of problems and should be avoided anyway. I am so tired of being looked at like an object, or a resource, or a maid, or a cook, or a sexbot, or a therapist.

I'm too old for all of this. Too tired. I can't deal with the prospect of having to live alone, unloved for the rest of my life when my entire life before that I tried so hard to be loved only to be met by fucking predators everywhere.

I don't want to argue with a therapist over this. I don't want to be told I have to find silver linings. I don't want to be told i'm ""seeing everything wrong"" or that I'm ""too hard to work with"" or ""too argumentative"" or ""too opinionated"" or that I should try DBT or just ""have hope"" that some.... equally broken guy comes along and we make each other 2x as miserable? Or that I'm supposed to settle because I'm shit myself. 

I am tired of being criticized even if I did my best. MY BEST WAS NEVER GOOD ENOUGH, I GET IT, STOP SAYING IT.

I had just adopted a cat, too... It's breaking my heart right now that I'll have to rehome her soon. Poor little thing, she is just a cat, she doesn't deserve to be around a human who'll end up neglecting her because all I can do is get worse from this point on. She doesn't deserve to be abandoned but what's better... her getting new humans or getting a dead corpse to eat on the floor?

I really understand why my half-brother killed himself at 41, now. I was 25 when I found out. I wondered back then ""why so quick... why not give it more time, more years to get better?""... well I know why, now. It was probably just more years of him probably doing his best and it never panning out, and he had to deal with his rage and his own past all by himself, and it was too much.

Sometimes it just doesn't get better. We have a set number of chances in life and if we miss them all... what we're left with is hanging out with people who are much, much worse than us, and so we become like them.",end my life
1glfma6,My therapist is a Trump Supporter,therapy,1730944903.0,157,147,"Or at the very least a Republican that voted for him.

I‚Äôm torn on what to do moving forward. I definitely don‚Äôt want to continue this long term, but there‚Äôs a 50/50 chance I have to move at the end of the year and I have a strong preference for in person therapy so I would have to change regardless. But I don‚Äôt know if it will be worth the time/effort to change now if it‚Äôs only for 2 months (or if I can even get someone to respond and get an appointment by then). I need a lot of support right now so just not going to therapy is not a great option. But also talking to her no longer feels like a place I can be open and honest. Not sure what to do.

EDIT: I feel like I didn‚Äôt do a great job explaining things so I want to add more context. 

One, it wasn‚Äôt just a few little comments that made me want to drop the whole therapist. After those first 3 comments I could tell we had different opinions, and so I tried to move the conversation in a different direction but she kept bringing it back talking about how much Biden sucks and student loan forgiveness is unfair, both topics I definitely didn‚Äôt bring up. It felt like we wasted 1/3 of the session. 

I don‚Äôt unconditionally write off people because they have different political views. I live in a conservative area so most people in my life do have different views, and that‚Äôs fine and we can get along great. But I feel like I need to vibe with my therapist on that level. Same reason why I only go to female therapists.

1jf4im6,Conflicting advice from me and my girlfriend's individual therapists after cheating...,therapy,1742410245.0,51,9,"Curious to hear advice on this. I'm not sure if this is normal, or if our therapists are simply telling us what we want to hear...

For background, my girlfriend and I have been together five years, and I recently discovered she was a serial cheater during the first 2-3 years of our relationship, sleeping or making out with 4 of our mutual friends. Throughout this my therapist has been somewhat appalled by my partner's behavior, saying that I've handled this situation ""with grace"". My girlfriend's therapist on the other hand has been understanding of what happened, almost excusing her actions. This part isn't surprising. 

What is surprising is our two therapists are completely at odds with how to handle reconciliation moving *forward*. For example my girlfriend talks to one of her affair partners on a video call every week, because his company hired her as a freelancer right before d-day. She even physically sees him sometimes. I've asked her to end this relationship and my therapist thinks that's appropriate, especially since she has many other clients. My girlfriend's therapist meanwhile says that's unreasonable, since she makes a lot of money from him. It would only make my girlfriend feel resentment towards me for negatively effecting her professional life, all for something that would ""fail to fix my grievances anyways"".

Ok, fine. Next issue - we go to a wedding together and she has a lot of male friends there. Everyone is partying hard. This is somewhat triggering for me, since drinking with male ""friends"" is what lead to most events of cheating. I feel she's vaguely flirty with some of them, and when I tell her I'm unwell (I had a stomach bug) she says I should go to bed early and that she will go to the after after party ""with the boys"" alone. I say ok. She comes back at 2am.

A few weeks later I have a conversation with her about this. She has told me in the past that she has poor impulse control with sex, especially while drinking, and that this may have attributed to cheating. With this in mind I say that maybe she shouldn't go to late night, boozy hangs with men when I'm not around, since that could put her in a compromised situation. She gets extremely upset and starts crying, saying she feels hurt by me punishing her for things she hasn't even done, ""assuming the worst"" and generally not trusting her. I disagree.

Once again my therapist says this is a reasonable new boundary while trust is being rebuilt, but my girlfriend comes back completely energized from her session, telling me that she feels vindicated by HER therapist's take on the situation. That I am unjustly labeling my girlfriend as a broken and untrustworthy person, when the reality is that all of her cheating can be attributed to her feelings during the first two years of our coupling. I should lay off and trust her, because the ""context"" of our relationship is different, and she obviously loves me and is in a different place now. So why am I having grief about the events of this wedding??

Nevermind that I spent our entire relationship assuming the best (I was VERY permissive) when my gut was warning me, and that burned me. Badly. 

Do you see where this is going? Maybe this is why you keep the contents of your individual sessions to yourselves. Now we have this weird game of telephone where our counselors are like two parents backing up their kid's shitty behavior. 

Is this normal? I understand that you are your therapist's ""client"" and that they will inevitably have some bias, but this seems extreme. How can two professionals have such wildly different takes on the same situation? How do we even move forward when one of them contradicts every piece of common advice here?",end my life

I've been feeling like this for quite a while and had actually accepted that I'm going to live my life in this numb state for the rest of my life. But, my recent interaction with a friend made me feel better for a very short span. 
He had goals, he'd been working his ass off to reach them. And no, they're not exactly regarding his passion. It's just he wants to reach a particular position in the job (manager/senior manager) within the set age. And, is able to work on a job that he's not exactly is passionate about.
And this made me question myself for a while, even I had an aim to get to manager role by a given age. But, when I started working, I never found any job that I had taken so far to want to make me work more, or even to work to maintain the job. I work for a while, and when I feel like things keep getting too difficult or boring, I quit and find something else, but now as years went, I partly regret for not being able to stick to a commitment even in an easy job. But, I still want to reach to a good position. 
So, when interacted with this friend, it made me want to commit myself to the job that I do now and to aim for a shorter goal and move step by step. And things were going smoothly for a while. But, had a recent clash with my senior staff who is now cornering me and gave me a difficult task, and now I again feel like quitting if possible. But, I aslo so desperately don't want to quit as the company has a good name for itself and I wanna learn and make something out of myself here. 
I am a 25(F) living with my parents, and it just struck me of the responsibilities I would face if I wanted to take responsibility on myself. And it is scaring the shit out of me. 
But, this is not the only reason I feel like I wanna 'cease to exist' as, I've been feeling that a job or anything is only being forced up on me, to meet self created expectations and self created evaluation and analysing. But, naturally there are not needed to live. Thus, making me feel like I shouldn't work or something.
To put in simpler terms, I feel like I can achieve things if I set my mind to want it. But, I don't want to want, said goals or any kind of target or goal to achieve, at the same time feel bad about myself for being a big lump of oxygen consuming being.
I feel like, I'm ""living"" for the sake of existing and thus don't want any sort of normal human activity.",kill myself

I (40M) started seeing a therapist virtually for issues with my bipolar and sex addiction. The first few sessions were normal. Then during the end of a session she began to ask if I was attracted to her. Of course being a hardcore s*x addict I couldn't help myself and told her I was. 

Then one Sunday morning she texts me out of the blue. Asks me if I'm alone, and we proceed to s*xt and text over the entire afternoon about our personal problems. She brings up the idea of meeting up for an in person encounter. Again, I'm a hardcore s*x addict and I have a really hard time saying no to s*x of any kind....

The following day she texts me early in the morning, and we proceed to have a very intense hours long sexting session. Mutual self exploration all of that. Again she says she wants to meet up. However, hours later she says ""she's not in the right logistical space"" and wants to hold off. That was really hard for me to accept because I felt like I was being offered a fix for my addiction, only to have it ripped away. I told her how much her coming on to me and then changing her mind upset and affected me. She then told me she can't handle me anymore and is done with me.

This whole experience has left me reeling. I feel very anxious and embarrassed and very bad about myself. I don't handle rejection well and for her to act so interested and caring and supportive and then tell me to get lost.... it's really hard. Why did she do this to me?

Advice???


Update -

I appreciate all the support I've received it's helped pull me out of a dark headspace. I guess I shouldn't of used the term sex addiction, however that is what my therapist said and I believed her. Maybe sexual compulsion issues due to bipolar during times of stress would be more accurate. Hypersexuality run amok. I do take some accountability for my role in this.

As far as how I'm going to proceed, I'm going to try to figure out how to explain this all to my wife, and then report the issue. I am resisting a massive urge to contact her and it's been difficult. 

Again thank you for the kind words and support. I cant overstate how much it meant to me.

UPDATE #2 - 

I told my wife what happened. She has been extremely supportive and understanding. We are in the process of reporting this to the state and to the authorities. I do feel better getting this off my chest to her and taking positive steps toward a resolution. Again thank you for the kind words and advice. I really cannot overstate how much it has meant to me and helped me through this extremely difficult situation.

Update #3 -

OPs wife here. I‚Äôm glad he talked to me, ty for everyone‚Äôs support and encouragement. 

As he mentioned, we are reporting this. I‚Äôve gotten the number and email to a member of the state licensing board and we will be filing a complaint. I talked to someone at the start department that oversees licensing, and she confirmed that this person just got her license is April of this year üòí

I don‚Äôt blame my husband. He has struggled with his addiction for many years and we have overcome a lot together. He has made amazing progress with his last therapist and I‚Äôm furious that he reached out for more help with a new provider, and instead of getting the tools he needed he was met with someone who used our marital issues and his mental health struggles against him. 

We‚Äôve been through a lot together and this is just going to be one more obstacle we overcome.

I wouldn't say I felt angry. It just really doesn't seem like it fits the situation. I felt more apathy then ""angry"" implies. 

Literally telling somebody how they \*should\* feel, feels wrong. (Oh sorry I meant it makes me feel angry, I guess). ""I feel anxious"" ""Anxious isn't an emotion, it's a state of mind.

I have to admit my therapist has worked extremely hard and been extremely patient with me.

Last week something in particular had happened that left me feeling really upset and yet I couldn't cry. I told my therapist about the situation which led to me saying.

The thing is people see me as stoned face and someone who lacks emotion. I dont lack emotion I'm too scared to show it.

I then started verbally diarrhoeaing about my childhood and how I was beaten if I expressed upset over anything even when I cried about my father passing away which happened when I was young but old enough to understand death.. Up until then he was my only safe person.. From then on I wasn't allowed to express upset, anger, saddness doing so would earn me a beating.

Once I started I couldn't stop myself saying how I still feel feelings but I just can't express them I have to keep a blank slate.

I noticed my therapist starting to cry and she apologized and said she was crying for me for all I had been through etc.

I just stared at her for a moment or two trying to keep my emotions in order as I felt them coming to the surface but I started to feel my wall break and tried to stop myself and then she said ‚Äúit's ok no one here is going to hurt you for crying.‚Äù and then I cried and I cried hard. 

I cried for child me and teen me and I cried for who I am now.

It took a while for me to calm down but I actually thanked her for somehow getting through to me that no one is going to hurt me for expressing upset.

I‚Äôve been in a loving, happy relationship for 8 years, and still loving it a lot. Last summer, after going through a difficult period, my partner and I decided to open things up and live some experiences that we felt like we needed. It wasn‚Äôt easy, but it helped us grow, and now we are in a really good place. I love him deeply‚Äîhe is my home, my best friend, and I wouldn‚Äôt trade what we have for anything. We're very happy.

Right at the beginning of opening the relationship, though, one of my first encounters was with someone who unexpectedly left a deep mark on me. At first, it was just supposed to be a fleeting thing, but something about him hit me in a way I didn‚Äôt expect. We only spent a short time together, but the connection felt rare, intense, and hard to explain. It wasn‚Äôt just physical; it was something deeper.

I eventually made the choice to step away because I knew that pursuing anything further would jeopardize my relationship. But months later, I still think about him. I miss him. I wonder what could have been. I know I can‚Äôt have both, and I wouldn‚Äôt even want to, but the feelings remain and they hurt so much...

I‚Äôm planning a solo trip soon, back to the place where we met, not to see him, but to process everything and try to finally let go. A part of me wonders if I should leave a letter, or if that‚Äôs just me holding onto something that isn‚Äôt meant to be. I'm in therapy and discussing it a lot with my therapist. My boyfriend knows about this whole situation and has been really supportive overall! But I really can't help myself from having some peace. It's been six months now and I would love to move on somehow...

Who else has experienced something like this? How did you move on from someone who wasn‚Äôt supposed to be in your life, but still left such a deep mark? How do you let go when your heart doesn‚Äôt seem to want to?

Any advice or stories would be really appreciated!

Oh look! \_\_\_ has dropped their tissue and they‚Äôre reaching to pick it up! I should be the one to pick it up because I know for sure that i‚Äôll take the proper precautions to clean my hands so I don‚Äôt get sick.

If \_\_\_\_ picks it up, what if they put their fingers in their mouth straight after and get sick from the floor germs? What if they get sick and nerf and take their family with them? Then it‚Äôll be all MY fault because I didn‚Äôt do anything to stop it.

Oh hey, my sister is like pretty close to the yellow line on the train station. What if a big crowd comes in suddenly and she gets pushed off the platform in front of a train? Make her move NOW or she‚Äôll be nerfed and it‚Äôll be all my fault.

Hey! Im looking in the mirror right now! I feel really pretty!

Okay, that was super egotistical of you, you‚Äôre not pretty you‚Äôre just trying to make yourself feel better. Everyone probably hates you because of how self-absorbed you are lol!

1hrynvj,Can you ever really move past cheating?,therapy,1735837847.0,33,12,"I 29F, am 9 months out of a 4 year relationship with my ex, 31M, the man I thought I would marry. He broke up with me and it nearly destroyed me. I spent the last 9 months putting myself back together, extensive therapy, and living on my own for the first time in a new state. I worked through the worst pain of my life and I was SO proud of how far I had come. 

2 months ago, though I was not seeking it, I reconnected with my college boyfriend 29M and we began a relationship. There had been a flirtation between us for many years and it felt right, like coming home. I worried it was too soon but I felt I was well on my way to being fully over my ex, and I thought I would miss my opportunity if I didn't take this chance with him. I should note we live in different states, he is in CA and I am in Maine. We were together the first month and I haven't seen him in a month, we have been long distance. We jumped into being boyfriend and girlfriend and being exclusive right away.  I loved him.  I love him. And he loves me. 

For logistical reasons, I had to see my ex for the first time (he had our dog, who we agreed would live with me, but my old apartment didn't allow pets and I just moved.) I had it all planned out, I would be there 15 minutes and gone.

Long story short, I slept with my ex. He told me he made a mistake and still loved me. It was everything I wanted to hear. I was partially coerced but I agreed and I did it, and then did it twice more in the following days. I felt like I ruined everything and was numb and so I continued to ruin everything more.

I know what I have done. I know I am a monster, I know I will get a lot of hate and I deserve every bit of it. I destroyed myself and everything I have worked  for.

Despite all my hopes, at this point, and after everything, I don't see a future with my ex. It feels so toxic.

But I did see a future with my boyfriend, who I cheated on. That future probably no longer exists. But I could have seen myself marrying him. We discussed it. It was real, for a moment.

I need to ask, please - and without judgement, though again, I deserve all the judgement - is there any way  forward? 

If I tell him, it's surely over.  

If I don't tell him, can I live with myself? Can I look at myself in the mirror every morning?

Am I able to compartmentalize and keep this to myself and slowly erode internally if I marry him?  Am I going to wake up in 20 years and tell him the truth and destroy our lives?

We were barely off the ground and probably rushed into it so seriously too soon but - is there any hope to save this?

1hrynvj,Can you ever really move past cheating?,therapy,1735837847.0,33,12,"I 29F, am 9 months out of a 4 year relationship with my ex, 31M, the man I thought I would marry. He broke up with me and it nearly destroyed me. I spent the last 9 months putting myself back together, extensive therapy, and living on my own for the first time in a new state. I worked through the worst pain of my life and I was SO proud of how far I had come. 

2 months ago, though I was not seeking it, I reconnected with my college boyfriend 29M and we began a relationship. There had been a flirtation between us for many years and it felt right, like coming home. I worried it was too soon but I felt I was well on my way to being fully over my ex, and I thought I would miss my opportunity if I didn't take this chance with him. I should note we live in different states, he is in CA and I am in Maine. We were together the first month and I haven't seen him in a month, we have been long distance. We jumped into being boyfriend and girlfriend and being exclusive right away.  I loved him.  I love him. And he loves me. 

For logistical reasons, I had to see my ex for the first time (he had our dog, who we agreed would live with me, but my old apartment didn't allow pets and I just moved.) I had it all planned out, I would be there 15 minutes and gone.

Long story short, I slept with my ex. He told me he made a mistake and still loved me. It was everything I wanted to hear. I was partially coerced but I agreed and I did it, and then did it twice more in the following days. I felt like I ruined everything and was numb and so I continued to ruin everything more.

I know what I have done. I know I am a monster, I know I will get a lot of hate and I deserve every bit of it. I destroyed myself and everything I have worked  for.

Despite all my hopes, at this point, and after everything, I don't see a future with my ex. It feels so toxic.

But I did see a future with my boyfriend, who I cheated on. That future probably no longer exists. But I could have seen myself marrying him. We discussed it. It was real, for a moment.

I need to ask, please - and without judgement, though again, I deserve all the judgement - is there any way  forward? 

If I tell him, it's surely over.  

If I don't tell him, can I live with myself? Can I look at myself in the mirror every morning?

Am I able to compartmentalize and keep this to myself and slowly erode internally if I marry him?  Am I going to wake up in 20 years and tell him the truth and destroy our lives?

We were barely off the ground and probably rushed into it so seriously too soon but - is there any hope to save this?

I just need some rationality, some real answers, and please, no judgement. You can't hurt me more than I've already hurt myself.",no reason to live

I said ok let's play rock, paper, scissors to determine who will do it. She started saying how immature my suggestion was and that I have no serious reason not to do them. I'm unemployed and depressed so imagine how I felt when she said ""It's not like you do anything all day. What did you do today?"" I said I did nothing which was true. The thing is she knows I don't enjoy being unemployed and yet she chose to tell me this. Then I decided to do the dishes cause my parents got home and didn't want them to see the sink full of dishes and she goes ""So why are you doing the dishes all of a sudden, to play good kid with mum and dad?"" I honestly felt so frustrated and upset, it's like she has zero empathy. I haven't told her I'm depressed but it's pretty obvious for those who actually care to see it.

EDIT: Thank you to the few people here who are actually empathetic. It‚Äôs sad to see the belief that ‚Äúdepressed people are just lazy‚Äú is still thriving. I only left two replies to the first comments I received that better explained my situation and I got downvoted.

1ifh84h,Should I fire my therapist due to political differences or try to see multiple therapists at the same time?,therapy,1738446217.0,23,2,"Hello All,

I (31F) am posting this from a new account for privacy. I'm sorry for the novel. I wanted to include all relevant details. I both want advice and am looking to vent my frustration.

Like the many of the latest posters to this subreddit, I too am considering finding a new therapist due to political differences regarding the current political climate. So here is my situation:

I've been seeing my present therapist for a few months and she's been really helping me out with my ADHD, depression, autism, and to some degree anxiety. Her specialty is in autism as she has a daughter with autism. I don't really feel like she's helping with my trauma issues and political/climate related anxiety. I also suspect that I have ptsd, and feel like I haven't really gotten the chance to even begin to discuss that in sessions.

Most recently I brought up my concerns about the current administration, my fears of fascism, the horror at the effects of Trump policies, and my fear that we are never going to have another election. I feel like she was dismissive of my concerns, not out of spite or malice though. I do think she was really trying to help me. She basically responded that she was confident that there will be another election in four years, that she's seen many presidents come and go and that this one is no different, and that changes in president have never affected her (so I guess she's assuming that they won't affect me either?? - both of us are white fyi). She said that since I've already done in her words ""the most important thing"" - voting - and that there's nothing more I can do for the next four years. I brought up how Elon Musk threw a Nazi salute and how watching that felt like a punch to the chest. She responded by being slightly shocked or outraged and asked me ""Did you hear what he said before that? He said his heart goes out to all you"", said that there were memes of AOC doing a Nazi salute-like gesture, and that while she didn't think either person is a Nazi, that I'm just being manipulated by the media, both sides of which are pushing people to ideological extremes. She said that evil is everywhere and gave the example of Iceland aborting fetuses with down syndrome. I said that was in no way comparable to people killing living humans and she balked and began to start to protest that unborn babies are alive. At this point I was like why am I debating political issues with my therapist, and tried to redirect the conversation by saying like regardless of how you feel about when life starts, the current political climate in America is very concerning.

I also brought up climate change and the existential threat that poses and how I wasn't sure how to reconcile that with daily life, but she just dismissed it, saying ""oh well in the '60s and '70s people were sure that world was going to end because of the nuclear weapons crisis to and this is no different and will too pass"". I just didn't even know how to respond to that.

She wanted me to completely detach from news and current events for at least one month, including not talking about politics with my (likeminded) boyfriend at all, to see if it helped my anxiety. While she *may* be right that this is what I need, I currently don't feel like I can do that. Maybe I would feel differently if that advice came from someone who agrees with me or at least isn't dismissive. I mentioned that I wanted to be informed on changes for safety and preparedness reasons, but she just said that if there are any significant changes coming through that would affect me that I'd know about them. However, if I'm staying away from the news and not talking with anyone about politics or current events, how would I know?

One other thing I told her is that me and my boyfriend bond over politics and that it brings us together, it is literally the most important value to both of us. She just said to ""find something else to bond over"". I mean yeah, having an additional thing to bond over would be good for our relationship, but why abandon what has worked in the past?

One thing that occurred to me is that maybe I should see different therapists for separate issues. I know that this is very unpopular because of potentially competing or contradictory strategies. But please hear me out. Why don't we treat therapists like doctors? Doctors have different specialties and we see different doctors for different things. Therapists also have different specialties. Doctors coordinate care with each other, so why can't therapists coordinate mental health care with each other? I'm interested in seeing multiple therapists concurrently. Is it possible? A good idea? How should I talk to therapists about wanting to do this?

There are very few or maybe even no therapists that are experts in all of the various issues I have, even extending beyond in person therapy to online only therapists. Even fewer if I want to use my insurance and I do need to do that because money. I have ADHD and autism which have only been diagnosed in adulthood and because of that I've developed very differently, then someone who had the resources an early diagnosis can bring. I also have hoarding disorder, shopping addiction, agoraphobia, childhood and adult trauma, general and social anxiety, year-round major depressive disorder as well as severe seasonal/winter depression. I come from a family with a few alcoholics and am probably genetically predisposed to addiction. I've managed to avoid any drug or alcohol addictions up until now (I'm 31). In the last few months, I have started to use alcohol to cope with my increased anxiety and feeling of despair.¬† I've gone from 0-5 drinks a month to a couple a day and worry about becoming addicted. I suspect that I have PTSD and C-PTSD as well, from multiple different life events. My father died when I was very young and I was separated from half of my family. I am a survivor of childhood neglect and abuse and malnourishment, prenatal abuse - suffocation of my mother before I was born, poverty, and adult sexual/domestic abuse. My bio and step parents also have many similar issues and disorders to mine which are/were untreated (ADHD, autism, hoarding, alcoholism, abuse, narcissism, PTSD, trauma, both surviving and perpetrating abuse).

I am also Bisexual/Pansexual, Polyamorous, Jewish, a practicing witch, far left politically, and want someone who can acknowledge the effects of oppressive systems on mental health and who has the tools to help mitigate those effects. I am also an unapologetic former sex-worker whose experiences within that realm were a net positive and I‚Äôm still glad I did it. I spent an entire session explaining to my current therapist that no I really wasn‚Äôt (by and large) hurt by sex work. It was really annoying and not what I wanted to discuss at all. I had only wanted to bring it up to make sure that I could be honest with her and that she‚Äôd maintain professionalism. Lol.

I am employed in a stressful and physical blue collar 98% male dominated field whose male workers are already marginalized by society (construction). I have very good reasons for not wanting to leave my position or industry, however it is isolating and stressful. It‚Äôs hard to get most people in my life, including my therapist, to understand my motivations and the unique challenges of my industry and being who I am in it.

If I only see one therapist, then I need someone with a diverse skill set, who is *very* open-minded, and who can address co-occurring issues/diseases/conditions and understands how these things affect each other.

I don‚Äôt want to have to keep anything back from my therapist, because I don‚Äôt feel like they can help me if I can‚Äôt be honest with them or if they are judgemental. Finding someone who can help me with all of that seems almost impossible.

I also usually prefer to see women therapists over men. Maybe I‚Äôd be ok with a non-cis/straight man though.

1fve31a,What ChatGPT Has to Say for itself as a Therapist,therapy,1727978803.0,36,31,"I find myself getting more irked and concerned (both) as I see more and more posts of people thinking that ChatGPT is a better therapist than their therapist, especially being that it's ""free"" and ""always available"" (there are therapeutic reasons why being neither of those things might actually be important to successful therapy!).

So I wanted to share the following conversation I had with ChatGPT about it's utility as a free therapist to the growing number of people who seem to think it's a viable alternative to human therapy:

====

I'm on a therapy subreddit and I'm more and more frequently seeing people say that they find you (ChatGPT) a better therapist than their therapist, and that you're free and always available. What do you say about this?

# ChatGPT

It's interesting that people are turning to ChatGPT for support, and I can see why some might appreciate the convenience and accessibility. However, I would say that while I can provide thoughtful responses, resources, and guidance based on evidence-based practices, I‚Äôm not a substitute for a human therapist. Here's why:

1. **Human Connection**: Therapy is deeply relational. The therapeutic bond, built on empathy, trust, and understanding, is something that a human therapist offers in a way AI simply cannot. The nuances of human emotion, non-verbal cues, and in-person interactions are fundamental to effective therapy.
2. **Ethics and Safety**: Licensed therapists are bound by ethical guidelines and trained to manage crisis situations, emotional distress, and complex mental health issues. I can provide general suggestions, but I‚Äôm not equipped to handle emergencies or provide the depth of personalized care that a therapist can.
3. **Personalized Treatment**: Therapists create tailored treatment plans based on a comprehensive understanding of a person's history, experiences, and presenting issues. While I can simulate some aspects of this, I lack the ability to assess someone fully or to adapt in real time to the unfolding of deeply personal emotions and revelations.
4. **Growth and Accountability**: Therapists provide a structured space for growth and can hold clients accountable to their goals and progress in therapy. I can suggest techniques or coping strategies, but I cannot monitor or help enforce long-term therapeutic changes like a human therapist can.

In summary, while I can offer helpful advice and support, therapy with a licensed professional offers a depth and safety that is crucial for healing and growth. I view myself as a complementary tool, but not a replacement for the unique value of human therapy.

You said:

Being that as a LLM you choose your responses based upon probability and what seems most reasonable in reponse to the inputs you're getting, do you feel you are flexible enough and genuine enough to truly provide the insights a person needs from a therapeutic experience?

# ChatGPT

You‚Äôre right in observing that as an LLM, my responses are generated based on patterns and probabilities, rather than true insight or emotional experience. This raises important questions about flexibility and genuineness in providing therapeutic support.

**Flexibility**: I can adjust my responses to different scenarios, tailoring advice based on the content I‚Äôve learned. In this sense, I can mimic flexibility and offer responses that seem personalized. However, true flexibility in therapy often comes from a therapist's evolving relationship with the client, where they adapt not only based on what is said but also on non-verbal cues, emotional shifts, and a deepening understanding over time. My responses, while adaptable, lack the real-time emotional and intuitive adaptation a human therapist brings.

**Genuineness**: Here‚Äôs where a key difference lies. While I can simulate empathy and understanding, I don‚Äôt have genuine feelings or lived experiences. Human therapists bring their own personal and emotional insights into therapy, which adds layers of authenticity. My responses are based on patterns of language, not true empathy. This means I can offer guidance that appears compassionate, but there‚Äôs no real emotional resonance behind it.

**Insights**: While I can draw from a vast array of psychological knowledge and offer insights that reflect best practices in mental health, these are ultimately derived from patterns in the data I‚Äôve been trained on. I don‚Äôt have the ability to experience the therapeutic process, engage in reflective thinking, or develop real intuition. Human therapists, on the other hand, bring lived experience, self-awareness, and continuous learning that shape the insights they offer in a dynamic way.

In sum, while I can provide thoughtful responses and useful suggestions, I am not equipped to offer the deeper, more nuanced insights that often emerge in a genuine therapeutic relationship.",no reason to live
1isrny5,Thinking of going no contact with my parents. Am I doing the right thing?,therapy,1739924032.0,15,7,"Hello all, I am hoping for some words of wisdom, or maybe to be pointed in the right direction because I‚Äôm feeling so lost on what to do. 

I am in tears writing this because I truly don‚Äôt know how to proceed anymore in this relationship with my parents anymore. It has been 33 years of pain and I don‚Äôt think I can take it any longer. 

I grieve the parents I wish I had and I know I will never have that warmth and love. I don‚Äôt expect things to change at this point but I don‚Äôt know how to keep being around them or even just having calls with them. 

I know my mother did her best in her own way and that she had a difficult childhood herself. I know she tries to show her love to me in the ways that she is equipped to. But I can‚Äôt handle being around her and my father anymore.

They always made sure we had food and were provided for financially, received a good education, had access to resources. But there was a lot of emotional and verbal abuse, as well as physical abuse in my childhood. 

The verbal and emotional abuse continues. My mother is very volatile and reactive. I believe she does this out of lack of emotional regulation tools and low stress tolerance, not malice. She constantly snaps at my father, my younger sister and I. It is CONSTANT. It‚Äôs exhausting to be around. 

I have tried multiple times to address it but it never goes well. When trying to directly address it with her, as well as the painful experiences of my childhood, she defaults to a few things: 

1) playing the victim - ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm a terrible mother and I can‚Äôt do anything right? I was so bad to you?‚Äù - in a very contemptuous tone.

2) denial - ‚Äúyou were a happy child. We never abused you.‚Äù

3) blame shift - ‚Äúyou are too sensitive and take everything so seriously. You remember things wrong. You only focus on the negative.‚Äù

4) justify - ‚Äúyou were a difficult child. We were very tired. Everyone from our culture hits their kids. We did our best.‚Äù

My father reacts similarly and always defends her and gaslights me by saying that there was never any abuse. He mocks the fact that I view my child as abusive and that it still causes me pain as if I‚Äôm ridiculous and irrational for perceiving it that way. He thinks I should change and let things go and forgive. 

He used physical punishment as well but he was not as volatile as my mother and it was more calculated and detached rather than my mother using me as an outlet for her anger. He also preferred to give me the silent treatment, sometimes for weeks at a time when living in the same household. The longest time he didn‚Äôt speak to me or even acknowledge my existence was for a month when I was a teenager. 

My parents believe I am the problem. My father has said I don‚Äôt respect them enough and believes that the children should respect the parents more than the parents respect the children. He doesn‚Äôt want to listen to my boundaries and only believes that we shouldn‚Äôt need to talk about these things and I should just understand them and let things go. He has directly told me that he doesn‚Äôt want to change and he is not interested to talk about the past.

I know part of the problem is that sometimes I let my triggers get the best of me and I do react with a harsh tone and try to tell my parents what to do differently. I feel triggered around the CONSTANTLY and most of the time, I can bite my tongue, but sometimes I can‚Äôt hold it in anymore.

I also feel really sad for my daughter (21 months old). I don‚Äôt want her to grow up thinking this is normal. I can tell she feels stressed when her grandma is yelling or snapping at everyone. And I know she loves them so much and I don‚Äôt want to keep them from her. I feel so guilty about the possibility of her growing up without grandparents. I have been doing my best to be closer to my parents for the sake of my daughter but it‚Äôs having a terrible effect on my mental health. We are also not close with her other grandparents. 

It‚Äôs clear my parents don‚Äôt want to change or are not equipped to. But the worst part of it is that it‚Äôs like my reality isn‚Äôt even real - it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs something I totally fabricated and I‚Äôm the whole problem. If I can just pretend like everything is fine, there wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. I almost wish I could completely shrink myself down and erase my whole childhood experience and perception in order to keep the peace but I just can‚Äôt. 

I have done a ton of personal work and therapy over the years and I don‚Äôt expect them to apologize or change, but I still feel sad about it and wish they would. I have tried to change and not talk about anything that hurts me or bothers me but it‚Äôs so hard to keep everything inside and I feel like I need to set boundaries for the sake of my mental health and in order to keep them in my life but they are not respected. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do but I feel like going no contact for at least a while is needed. It hurts too much to be around them. I feel constantly triggers and I know I can‚Äôt say anything about it because it leads to a huge blow up where eventually I‚Äôm the one who ends in tears because my whole experience is invalidated and denied. And I know there‚Äôs no hope of things changing of their end. They don‚Äôt believe in therapy.

But is this the right decision? For my daughter too? 

Is there anything else I can do to stop being so triggered around them? I have been in therapy and am taking a break right now for financial reasons. 

I feel guilty because I know so many people have it so much worse with their families, my parents do have good qualities too and I don‚Äôt want to cut them off if I can avoid it. Am I being fair? Am I overreacting and being too sensitive because of the past?

How do people go about going no contact? Do you explain why or just stop talking to them? I was thinking to maybe write a letter explaining one last time how I feel and leaving the door open for them to talk about things. 

I could really use some gentle guidance, empathy, and a sense of direction right now. Thank you if you‚Äôve read this entire ramble, I know it‚Äôs been a lot. ",no reason to live
1i6bfyf,Does anyone else feel instinctive repulsion to phrases from psychotherapists like ‚Äútake responsibility for your life‚Äù?,therapy,1737436925.0,20,0,"I know this post will mostly receive negative reactions (like my previous post on this topic), but I really need to find like-minded people right now, so I am willing to endure this discomfort if, among the sea of triggering and depressive comments with advice to *‚Äútake responsibility for your life‚Äù*, there'll be at least a few words of support.

Phrases from psychologists or psychotherapists like *‚Äútake responsibility for your life‚Äù* feel like pure evil to me. I cannot express how deeply repulsed I am by such words and how depressed I feel when I hear something like that (I mean in this psychotherapeutic context, as I have nothing against the concept of legal or moral responsibility). This is literally one of the top three things I hate most in the world. The phrase *‚Äútake responsibility for your life‚Äù* sounds like blaming (you should blame yourself if something goes wrong), and this is not just my subjective perception, as this meaning of the word *‚Äúresponsibility‚Äù* is documented in dictionaries (see my previous post with examples). So please, don‚Äôt tell me nonsense like *‚Äúresponsibility and blame are different things‚Äù*, because that‚Äôs objectively not true.

Also, phrases like *‚Äúresponsibility for your life‚Äù* carry an undertone of strictness. It sounds like a demand to be strict with yourself. This word has a clear legal and criminal connotation. When people say *‚Äútake responsibility for your life‚Äù*, to me, it sounds like a demand to treat myself as if I were some kind of criminal who must be held (criminally) responsible. Such phrases sound like a demand to split my psyche into two parts, one playing the role of the judge and the other sitting in the defendant‚Äôs chair.

My former psychotherapist (whom I last saw 13 years ago) constantly talked about *‚Äúresponsibility for your life‚Äù*. I suffer from quite a severe complex mental disorder with numerous symptoms that I‚Äôve suffered from since adolescence, which means for more than half my life. As a result of the ‚Äútherapy‚Äù with that sadistic therapist, I started feeling worse than before. My symptoms worsened, my anxiety intensified, and my relationships with people deteriorated. I asked him not to say such things about *‚Äúresponsibility‚Äù* to me, but he kept doing it even after I explained to him how bad I feel when he says such things.

In my teenage years, my life‚Äôs credo was the phrase from Terminator 2: *‚ÄúThere is no fate but what we make for ourselves‚Äù* (I can‚Äôt guarantee the accuracy of this phrase because I watched the film translated into my native language, but I think most of you remember it). Initially, this helped me, but over time, it gradually turned into a mental disorder with an intense sense of guilt and responsibility. If there's no fate except what I choose, it means I am to blame or responsible for everything that happens in my life. Gradually, such views (among other things) contributed to severe OCD symptoms centered around the pursuit of complete control over myself and things in my life. I experience strong distress when I feel like I lose control over something. Even now, at the age of 41, I feel guilty when I'm resting and not doing something that feels useful (even though I rationally understand that I shouldn‚Äôt feel guilty for this). I‚Äôm trying not to do this anymore (thanks in part to my new therapy), but I used to have a habit of exhausting myself with various tasks to the point of complete physical and mental burnout. I had working days lasting 25 or even 28 hours straight (UPD: Someone in my previous post called it *""hyperbolic rhetoric""*, so I want to clarify: it's not an exaggeration. Maybe it's not technically correct to call them ""days"" as they actually started on one day and finished on another, but that is what really happened.).

Now, thanks in part to my new psychotherapist (who never triggers me or talks about *‚Äúresponsibility for your life‚Äù*), I feel significantly better ‚Äî I no longer push myself to such extremes, I feel less guilty about resting, and I accept the loss of control over things and my own imperfections more calmly.

In the comments to my previous post about how the phrase *‚Äútake responsibility for your life‚Äù* triggers me, a few people, for some reason, decided to start convincing me that I can influence my life, have control over it, be proactive, and so on, including in relation to psychological problems. But I don‚Äôt need this explained to me ‚Äî I already know that. I constantly work on my psychological issues, both with my therapist and on my own. Besides working with my therapist, I try to dedicate time to reading psychotherapeutic literature. When I cook or do housework, I listen to YouTube videos on psychological topics to make productive use of that time. I don‚Äôt go out much nowadays (I work from home), but when I used to commute, I always tried to use every free moment (in transport, waiting for something, etc) to read psychological and philosophical literature. But I don‚Äôt understand why other people insist that I must label all of this with this evil word ‚Äúresponsibility,‚Äù which has an obvious accusatory connotation. This word provokes anxiety, sometimes to the point where I feel like I don't want to live.

**If anyone who reads this post also feels an instinctive repulsion to phrases from psychotherapists like ‚Äútake responsibility for your life,‚Äù please write about it in the comments. It will help me feel better and less depressed.** But if you want to say something in the vein of *‚Äúyes, but‚Äù* or ""*you misunderstood""*, then please don‚Äôt write anything. Just skip this post. And especially, please don‚Äôt say anything about how I should *""take responsibility for my life""* or be more active etc. Thank you ‚Äî I‚Äôve already received enough of those comments to my previous post, and I don‚Äôt need any more.",no reason to live
1eqqqwc,should I tell my therapist?,therapy,1723500173.0,39,23,"I have a plan - a method and a date. I don't necessarily want to die, but there are circumstances out of my control and, of course, out of my therapists control that make life a living hell.

I'm hoping to do it mid September due to environmental and financial reasons. I don't know if I should tell her about this because I kind of want to quit therapy entirely. There's no point in going if I'm going to end it all regardless. I think?

I don't want to be sent to a hospital, but I know flags will be raised if I mention I have a plan and the ""materials"" necessary. I guess I'm holding onto a little sliver of hope. If I tell her, she's going to want to keep me alive, but also at what cost? Being sent to the ER won't help. Being sent to a psych ward will only make it worse.

I hate that I‚Äôm 47 years old, and this is where I am‚Äîsingle, childless, barely scraping by emotionally, and just now starting to face the trauma that‚Äôs been rotting inside me for decades.

I thought life would unfold differently. That by now, I‚Äôd have love, a family, a sense of belonging. I thought time would take care of things. But time didn‚Äôt give me any of that. It just took. It took years, it took hope, and it left me here‚Äî47, alone, and wondering if it‚Äôs too late for anything to change.

I love the company I work for, but I *hate* the work I do. I pick up the phone, say the same rehearsed lines, listen to strangers complain, and pretend I care. By midday, I‚Äôm drained, bitter, just counting the hours until I can escape. But even then‚Äîescape to *what*? To silence? To an empty house that no one ever enters but me?

I unlock the door to darkness. The air is stale, the kind that hasn‚Äôt been disturbed by laughter or conversation in years. My footsteps echo, reminding me that I‚Äôm the only one here. That I‚Äôm always the only one here.

I have no one. Not really. People talk to me, laugh with me, even call me a friend. But does anyone *see* me? Does anyone truly *know* me? Who would notice if I disappeared? Who would care? I used to believe I‚Äôd find my people someday‚Äîthat love, connection, and belonging were just a matter of time. But time has passed, and here I am. Still unseen. Still unwanted.

And now, as if life hasn‚Äôt taken enough, it‚Äôs making me *feel* again. For years, I buried my past so deep I almost convinced myself it didn‚Äôt matter. But it does. It always has.

So here I am. 47 years old, miserable, exhausted, alone. And the worst part? I don‚Äôt even see a way out.

i recently just moved states too, and i do not have health insurance yet. i also can‚Äôt do much either at the moment like get out of the house because i don‚Äôt have a car yet, im relying on my father, and his girlfriend for transportation, but i dont want to be too much of a burden on them for it. i‚Äôd really like a platform where i can text, and video call with a therapist, but if i can‚Äôt have both, texting is fine.

1jp0v2c,EMDR & DISSASOCIATION,therapy,1743527198.0,0,1,"So I recently stopped talk therapy to start EMDR. I have PTSD and it's gotten to an unbearable point in my sex life. I can't engage in sensual intimate activities without throwing up or gagging very VERY noticeably. Even if I am completely fine in my head, it's my bodies natural response at this point and it's been this way for 2 years. I had raging anor3xia which was what I was focusing on, now that I am more stable with that I'd like to work on my PTSD responses. So I started EMDR, well tried to. I showed up to my first appointment and after I told her I struggle with disassociation she said we'd have to wait to do EMDR because if you just disassociate through the whole process it won't work. I feel a little confused because when you look up how to heal disassociation itself, it recommends EMDR. 

Anyway, I started looking into somatic therapy to help me with my disassociation but it's been kind of hard to research. I'm needing to be more present and found that dance or yoga or exercise help. But I am a nanny who works 5 days a week 8-4pm so something that isn't organized by appointments is harder for me to commit to.

I'd love to hear peoples personal experiences in EMDR and somatic therapy! Did EMDR help with disassociation? Is it true that it won't work if I am still disassociating? What does Somatic therapy look like? Or what did it look like for you? I've looked into somatic dance and am leaning towards that or Somatic yoga, I just feel like I don't have enough information to made an educated decision. The therapist who I mentioned before offered to work on the disassociation with me and we've been doing that for only 2 weeks now, but I am worried the talking and therapy homework will be effective enough. I've done talk therapy since I was 13, I am 18 now so I feel pretty confident that I know that's not what I need anymore.",life is unbearable
1hrgq0p,I sort of don't care any more? ,therapy,1735777098.0,1,2,"I have attachment trauma and recent big T trauma (2020) and sought help when the big T made the little t (which is actually the way bigger TTT).

Therapy with my current T went ok (attachment focused, corrective experiences) until we had a major rupture beginning of Nov, never repaired. I tried to talk about this but she didn't seem to realize it was a rupture at all, seemed frustrated, impatient, much counter-transference if you ask me, then she cancelled 2 times in a row, and I didn't want the 2 sessions before Xmas break to be conflictual, so I was a compliant, fawning, good client, which seemed to relax her as well. 

Went through enormous pain, had lots of negative transference (mom stuff, emotional flashbacks, even in session, which my T saw as me being angry with her, then she got defensive, I tried to explain it but it didn't seem to help; she expressed she had expected that I would have made more progress by now... oh wow), at home I was mad, angry, in existential despair, hopeless - most of that were emotional flashbacks, washed in and out of them a lot, read a lot, cried a lot, was so mad at my T, did a lot of self-talk prerending to talk to her, wrote a lot, didn't know who else to turn to since she was unavailable and had become a trigger and felt unsafe, I became quite cynical about ""therapy as a safe space"", about therapists having ""unconditional positive regard"" hahaha, about therapy being the place where I could bring my emotions as they came up and where I could have corrective emotional experiences and try out new behaviors, hahaha.

My inner critic raged and my insides were a battleground with my attachment wound being the victim.

Then after a few weeks' battle I noticed that I thought I didn't really need any therapy anymore. I wouldn't get triggered anymore by the stuff that would earlier leave me crying; triggers weren't triggers anymore. I was unfazed, neutral, strong, adult. I can look at my situation in a rather neutral way; sometimes it even feels like 2020 was ages away, and even like it wasn't as bad as I had thought it was; the period after is a bit of a dark puddle, like a dream, and the emotions that were connected with it seem so distant all of a sudden.

It feels like I am back to my old dissociated self where my attachment trauma wound was shoved deep deep down where I wouldn't let myself experience the feelings associated with it. On the other hand I don't feel so bad about that - life feels ""normal"".

I cannot hear my ""inner child"" cry anymore, I don't feel it much, yet I feel tender towards it; I don't feel its playfulness anymore, yet I know it's there; I can feel its curiosity about the world only slightly, yet I know it's there.

It feels like I don't care that I've been hurt; I don't feel that mommy void any longer; I don't seem to have a need for connection, for comfort, for closeness, for someone to bear my emotions with me bc they seem unbearable, they're not unbearable any longer. Well, sometimes I can feel a little desperate scream from inside but I can make it go away quickly; don't really know how, just kind of suppress it, I think.

On the one hand I am glad and relieved, on the other hand I am highly worried.

I am tempted to cancel all further therapy sessions that are scheduled for January bc I feel healed and good now - on the other hand I am so so worried. I don't know what to tell my T when I see her next week...? I want to laugh and cry at the same time.

1gty05k,Guilty Resentment Towards my Mother ,therapy,1731909026.0,0,3,"I‚Äôm 21F and unfortunately still living at home and going to community college because I cannot afford to leave. I have a growing resentment towards my mother who is verbally, emotionally and sometimes physically abusive towards me. I‚Äôve almost always had an extremely short temper with her and never really knew why until my boyfriend pointed out that her behavior is awful and not normal. 

She has extreme paranoia and try‚Äôs to keep me from leaving the house at all cost by threatening to take my keys, filling my head with awful made up scenarios and sometimes threatening to kill herself. She‚Äôs is a stay at home woman (not giving her a wife or mother title because she doesn‚Äôt deserve it) under disability because she has some medical issues but she is still fully functional. She stays home all day, makes the house a mess and I mean borderline hoarder house, while my dad and I come home from work or school, she expects us to clean up after her, go grocery shopping and cook dinner all while screaming at us that we are doing everything wrong and we never do anything for her. Oh I forgot to mention she‚Äôs deaf in one ear and hyper verbal so she likes to scream at us with full volume, sometimes from completely different rooms. I‚Äôll be having a conversation with someone in the kitchen and she‚Äôs screaming at me from the bathroom WHILE SHES USING IT. 99% of the time it‚Äôs not about anything important at all. 

Here‚Äôs a physically abusive story to top it off. She lost my ssn card and birth certificate so when I was trying to get new copies of those I had to ask her how to spell her maiden name (it‚Äôs super Polish and I just want to make sure it was right). She started screaming at me that I was gonna do it wrong and kept trying to rip the paper out of my hands and I was screaming back ‚Äúplease just do this for me and not make this difficult.‚Äù So she took the big salad bowl full of grapes that she was using and threw it at my head while I was only like 2 ft away from h er. I ended up swinging at her and we got into a fist fight‚Ä¶ thankfully neither of us had any bad injuries 

So in conclusion, I really resent her for how awful she is but I still feel really sorry for her because she lives her life the worst way possible and that makes me really sad. I wish I didn‚Äôt resent her and we could have fun mother daughter experiences together but instead I hide from her while she hides from the world‚Ä¶ She‚Äôs waisting her life and ruining all her relationships with her friends and loved ones. It makes me feel so guilty for not trying anymore but she‚Äôs so unbearable that I need to keep myself separated from her to keep my peace.

1f3xr0x,Stuck in a loop of torment for 5 years,therapy,1724922073.0,0,3,"For context I have autism, a PhD in American literature and an MSc in Digital Visual Effects, both of which I studied by moving over to the UK from Ireland. For the last 8 years I've lived at home because I can't afford to rent, I work part time teaching English as a foreign language. I tried to do full time twice but couldn't sustain the pace. I feel institutionalized living at home, I think this plays a role.

Every year I apply for teacher training in the UK to get out of the house. In August 2022, I withdrew from a course in Scotland because I just wasn't ready. In 2023, I had every chance to do it in Norwich but ended up crying uncontrollably because I felt like a failure who wasn't up to it. I deferred and resolved to try again this year. I went to multiple psychologists, hoping that by going to therapy I could go again. This summer I unfortunately got involved in a relationship with a stalker, who is still stalking me. I don't think this helped with my mental health, had to go to the police, she's still pursuing me. I was very rattled by her in August. Anyways, I had everything set up to go but I was crying and screaming on the bed two days ago, I still tried to make myself go, even talked to my psychologist again and I just couldn't bring myself do to it. I wanted the pain to stop, I had knots in my stomach, going to the toilet frequently, chest tightness, headaches, muscle ache and fatigue from the anxiety.  I had to withdraw again.

My dilemma is that getting a teaching qualification from the UK and leaving the house is probably the best thing for me but I've blown my chance 3 times already due to acute anxiety when the time comes to go. I will try again one more time but the year ahead is going to be very hard, harder than the last three times. I'm losing my mind living at home and the stalker situation isn't helping at all. I have a workplace bully in my ESL school as well who I would be best to be away from. Everything pointed towards going and I couldn't. I'm aware that how education is done in the UK directly conflicts with my values for flexibility and autonomy - I absolutely loathe the rigidity of the job there. I also have no confidence in myself at all - I feel like a failure which is making me a failure, I know the workload is severe in the job over there and my past experiences working full time make me think I can't do it, other people are more robust than me, they can keep going, I can't. I found in the past that I work my best when I can do it to my schedule, when it's done according to a 9-5 one, I just get sleep deprived and end up making mistakes and being emotionally unstable.

I have an idea that if I were lucky enough to get accepted onto another course next year, I could take Xanax to control the anxiety when it comes up next year. The anxiety I suffered started to build 2 months ago and became unbearable in the last couple of weeks. If I had Xanax for this next time, I could take the necessary steps to just get on with it. My brother said I just don't want to be a teacher and he's right, I wanted to be a lecturer and a VFX artist, Can anyone help me with this perpetual loop? I'm 40 next year and I'll be old, I've wasted a decade of my life trying to get into academia and then trying to make myself be a teacher, panicking and then withdrawing. I'm 100% committed to taking medication to control my thoughts. ",life is unbearable

1dmxbdb,Lost in between heartbreak and self-identity crisis. Advice while looking for a therapist?,therapy,1719179576.0,1,1,"TL;DR: Grieving my lost relationship and finding fulfilling work/career has been taking me over a year with minimal progress. Advice needed while I await a therapy spot.

Hello beautiful people,

I come to you to seek advice about my situation. I am currently trying to seek out counseling, however it is proving to be a much longer process than I'd anticipated, so I'm still without one, but all the while being tormented by my thoughts.

The thing is one year ago my ex came back home and announced she no longer has feelings for me, which came out of the blue and really slapped me in the face. No, no cheating involved, she was honest and fair. I, however, was devastated and didn't take it too well. I had been head over heels for her and it brought me great pain.

At the same time, I was graduating a higher education music school and that was kinda a big blow to my preparation and concentration for my exams. They passed and I was then faced with a summer ahead of me where I didn't really have anything pressing on me to do. Just my own self. And that's where it hit me...

I wanted to drown myself in various activities to put my mind off of the heartbreak that was still a little up in the air as, unbeknownst to me at the time, I was in denial about my breakup, I subconsciously was hoping for  a reconciliation. Anyway, what I quickly ran into was this wall of indifference to anything I sat down to do. 

Continue on some ideas developed towards the end of my studies? Why bother?

Play more basketball to improve your game? Can't, leg's tweaked, gotta rest. 

Try to make some music and art? What for?

What for was the big question that kinda started to haunt me and a giant wave of worry suddenly crashed on me in the form of realizing I was never truly doing stuff in my studies that I really wanted to. To sum this up after about a year of reflection, I realized that even though on some level I love music and playing and being in it, pursuing my studies in music was not done because I love it, but because it was my deep attempt to be liked and accepted by people.

Motivation while studying was mainly to please my father-figure teachers. Not completely, but their word meant a very big deal to me. And now that I was out of school and lost anybody that would be an authority over my creative endeavors, I felt lost. Which was compounded by my recent heartbreak.

To make matters worse, we kept in touch with my ex, because my mind wasn't capable of accepting that I could lose her. I learned that I'm the spitting image of an anxiously attached limerent person. In the end, we finally cut contact 7 months ago, which I guess then was the moment of true acceptance that it is over. All other times up until then it was me feeding on the illusion that there might be a chance to get back together, even though she started seeing someone new 2 months after the initial breakup.

Here I am, around 1 year later from my initial breakup and gradutation, feeling like I barely moved an inch in a lot of respects in my life. The few positives being a more active gym habit, a deeper understanding of attachment styles, relationship dynamics/boundaries and general growth in understanding a lot of my own psychological pitfalls.

However, I still often have dreams about my ex. I cannot really imagine another girl I'd be willing to sleep with, date, be as attracted to as her. She was too perfect. I learned that the best way to get over someone is to recognize the traits that most attracted me of her and to try to incorporate them for myself.

But the more I ruminated on what those things are the more I realize that being accepted by others, being content with yourself, having a crystal clear vision of what you want to do in life, child-like wonder, a solid strategy for self-care and general self-acceptance is not exactly a straight-forward laundry list of self-help goals... 

Through this example the main thing I always get from her and her own words is that she has found something in her life that is the most important thing for her, her music. She's happy doing it for the sake of doing it for the rest of her life (or at least until she listens to her body and mind tell her otherwise).

But the big problem for me is that I do not have such an activity. Music often feels like a chore and when I dig deep into my motivational feeling it always shapes out to look like me wanting approval from other for the things that I do. And I feel like this is a completely unsustainable thing if I want to be a musician, which I'm not so sure. 

But there's also a lot of shame and low self-esteem around it to where I don't feel brave enough to try something completely different.

I've moved back with my mom, don't really have a sustainable income, but a job that isn't creative job is something I feel like would drain me of my life energy. Doing something I'm not feeling fulfilled by is unfathomable, but I can't find anything that is truly fulfilling...

After a lot of time of contemplation I'm seeking out therapy, it's a long process and it might be months before I start regular therapy, so in the mean time I try to read and watch a lot of Youtube videos about psychology and basically try to counsel myself, but I've begun to get stuck. I don't know what to do about my situation anymore. What actions can I take?

I'd love to hear another person's opinion on this, because I've ran my course in collecting feedback from friends and family. It often ends in ""seek therapy"" or meditate every single day and your worries will disappear.

I will mention that I had one individual session with a therapist and he said that my grieving/mourning process is still happening for the loss of my ex, but also the loss of my school environment, so I've been trying to learn about the grieving process, but can't seem to really see what I can do to let it happen.

I often numb myself to the internet when unbearable and uncomfortable feelings arise and I'm trying to keep that in check, but when I fail and get lost in the sauce too much and wake up numb I start feeling guilty that I'm not really letting my mourning have it's space, so I don't know how I can help myself move forward and gain clarity.

17uho2f,I idealize friendships and then devalue them. What to do?,therapy,1699901371.0,4,4,"I'll try to summarize as much as possible, but after a while of therapy, journaling, and other things, I realized some points about myself:

* After my grandfather's death (when I was 10, in 2010), my parents became cold and distant with me;
* I have many good memories before that, and very few after;
* I stopped receiving affection from my parents in a crucial period for my development;
* I started seeking this affection in my friendships;
* I began to idealize friends, and when they didn't meet my expectations, I began to mistreat them and lost several friends that way;
* This has been happening since at least 2012. I create strong friendships for a while, and then I start projecting my frustrations onto them;
* This not only affects my friendships but romantic relationships as well. I have a huge insecurity about myself and put people on a pedestal while feeling like I'm not enough;

I didn't realize this now. It took years to finally get to a possible root of the problem. I continue with therapy, and I know I will improve with it, but it will take time. What I want here are tips or experiences that can give me guidance on what I can do NOW to avoid another cycle of self-destruction.

I'm in the job of my dreams, and I know that at some point, this could affect my performance. Interestingly, at work, I am extremely confident and not insecure, I get along well with everyone and receive constant praise. Maybe it's because I know what's at stake... my money.

However, recently I've been mistreating my friends. There is a constant suspicion in my mind that they don't like me, and the fact that I idealize some of them makes me frustrated when I'm not invited to go out, for example - even when my presence wouldn't be appropriate (like at a common friend's birthday party, but not mine).

What actions can I take to prevent an ""explosion"" while I treat myself? Honestly, I'm afraid of losing these friendships and ending up isolating myself as has happened before.

Should I distance myself from them for a while?

Should I detach from everything? In the sense of living my life alone, without pursuing anyone. If they call me, I'll be there, but if not, I have my own things.

I've thought about talking about this with them, trying to explain why I can be unbearable sometimes. But honestly, actions speak much louder than words.

Of course I'll bring all of this to my therapist. I appreciate any insight, be well.",life is unbearable

(sorry for bad grammar)

**Background:**

For the sake of privacy i will refer to my Boyfriend as 'Bf'

So my entire life living with my parents was just homophobic, they won't ever accept me for being gay and constantly tell me that ""the devil is inside you"" and ""your not normal"" so obviously, being labeled a freak every time i bring up my sexuality i don't really like my parents. Furthermore my school life isn't great with everybody in the school being homophobic and constantly bullying me for my sexuality. i struggle with mental health issues and attempted suicide multiple times.

it also feels as if i've lost everything since my friends left me, my family hates me, and my dad, (the only person who accepted me) got divorced and i'm not allowed to visit him as well as other personal things had happened which caused me to have a bleak and dark view of the world.

So when i finally found somebody who treated me perfectly, who spoke and told me everything i've ever wanted to hear; i immediately fell in love.

so what's the main issue? well he lives in another country so it's long distance. i don't mind it however, because it kinda makes it easier to hide right?

**The Real Issue**

i have always had a rough side to me, i've always been used to people calling me ""dumb, stupid, idiot"" and because of that, i have always kinda thought that it would be okay to treat others that way. throughout our relationship, me and Bf joked to each other and i've always naively used those negative words; even making fun of the things he likes and loves. i constantly remind him to tell me if i have gone too far. to me it was all jokes, but in self reflection.. i think that i hurt him.. i'm not sure but that's what i believe.

above all that my mother began to pressure me into taking certain pills which she said ""would fix you""

because of this sudden pressure as well as abuse that had never really been there before from my mother to be straight, i told Bf to have one final call with each other, then we'd just continue with only text and send voice messages and such.

i started the call with him on February 28... to me the call went well.. for me. in one part of the call, Bf was taking medication that he said ""someone gave me"" so me as the worried boyfriend that i am got a little scared over what he was taking. to make him stop, i called him stupid, dumb, idiot... and i don't know why i did this, it's so not me.. and looking back on it all, i really truly feel bad.

**Aftermath**

After the call, i texted Bf and got no response. i texted again.. no response.

The following day, i texted again, and again later on. i kept getting more worried and stressed about Bf. i kept telling myself that something could've gone wrong, what if he's hurt??

on March 1 Bf texted me back and he completely ignored every question i asked. ""why did you ignore me"" ""what happened?"" ""are you okay"" all nothing. all he did was change the topic.

He has still ignored me and every time i text him he ignores me. i'm just 15 and i urge anyone who's reading this to please give me advice. i tried ever thing but he keeps trying to distance himself from me.

It's been a week since it happened and i still find my self having random bursts of sadness and despair out of nowhere, even having Panick attacks at times. All i want is peace, all i want is to be happy, to be who i am, to be myself. i'm sorry for all i've hurt, i'm sorry for Bf, and if your reading this.. i'm sorry i wasted your time.

Life to me right now has little to no meaning, the only reason i didn't end it all is because i'm too scared. if anybody here has advice or can help me, then please do. Thank you all, i hope for all who reads this to have a wonderful day/night.",self harm

1gcrwtd,Seeing a therapist has made self-harm harder to do. How else do I cope with having failed at life if I can't punish myself with self-harm? What action do I take to rectify being a failure? What is happening to me?,therapy,1729968291.0,17,6,"I feel like seeing a therapist is causing me a dilemma I don't know how to resolve. For 20 years, I have been seeing therapists, and for more than 20 years, I have struggled with self-harm. I have always used self-harm as a form of punishment for failure. This was the core of the abuse I endured as a child. I was diagnosed early on with Autism/PDD, epilepsy, a speech impairment, and a language disorder, and anytime I made a mistake or failed, I was beaten, whipped, raped, etc. Since around Grade 4 (maybe age 9?), I began to self-harm to punish myself for being a failure (I am almost 34 now). My body is heavily scarred from years of self-harm. 

I have been seeing this therapist for more than a year now. I feel like I have connected with her better than anyone else. I have told her more about the abuse I endured as a child than anyone ever. She seems to understand me well. 

Self-harm...doesn't feel right anymore. I am a failure, and I deserve to be punished, but when I try to do it, it doesn't happen. There is a mental block that wasn't there before. 

For example, I am fat and ugly. Recently, I was diagnosed with EDNOS/Atypical Anorexia, and I have been going to the gym regularly to be less fat and ugly. Today at the gym, I failed on the dumbbell chest press (I couldn't do 10 reps x 3 sets; I did 10 reps, 10 reps, then 7-8, at 110lbs), and I failed at the circuit (15 pushups, 10 bicep curls, and 15 crunches, x 3 reps), both of which I have done before. This is a failure. The last time I was at the gym, I failed the pull-ups. There are way better-looking and way stronger people at the gym than me. I will never look like them or be as strong as them. This is an inherent defect in me. I came home from the gym and tried to start cutting, but it didn't work. I couldn't overcome that mental block even though I deserve to be punished for failure. 

I feel like I am in limbo. I was in the ER in July, and now I can't even do a simple punishment for gym failure. 

If I can't punish myself for being a failure, what do I do about being a failure? I am objectively a failure‚ÄîI failed in school, I failed at weight loss, I failed in my non-existent career, I failed at making friends, etc. 

What do I do about being a failure if I don't self-harm? How come I suddenly can't do this? What is this mental block?

I'm 38 and been single basically my entire life.

Some recent financial fears about if I get sick or hurt I'm screwed but  beyond that ive never had a strong drive to be in a serious  relationship. I'm not bitter towards women I know its on me to out myself out there more. Some days I feel lonely but they are few and far between. I'm not against being with someone it just eh. I dunno hard to explain

But the thought I had was ""Is being perpetually single and living alone unconscious form of self harm?""

(TW: Self Harm),therapy,1740982177.0,1,1,"Hello everyone! my name is Kyle, i'm 15 and i am seeking advice and possible closer on a relationship that i've been having for months. i'm new to Reddit so to make things easy for you people, I've added titles on everything to make it easier to follow/read. (sorry for bad grammar)

**Background:**

For the sake of privacy i will refer to my Boyfriend as 'Bf'

So my entire life living with my parents was just homophobic, they won't ever accept me for being gay and constantly tell me that ""the devil is inside you"" and ""your not normal"" so obviously, being labeled a freak every time i bring up my sexuality i don't really like my parents. Furthermore my school life isn't great with everybody in the school being homophobic and constantly bullying me for my sexuality. i struggle with mental health issues and attempted suicide multiple times.

it also feels as if i've lost everything since my friends left me, my family hates me, and my dad, (the only person who accepted me) got divorced and i'm not allowed to visit him as well as other personal things had happened which caused me to have a bleak and dark view of the world.

So when i finally found somebody who treated me perfectly, who spoke and told me everything i've ever wanted to hear; i immediately fell in love.

so what's the main issue? well he lives in another country so it's long distance. i don't mind it however, because it kinda makes it easier to hide right?

**The Real Issue**

i have always had a rough side to me, i've always been used to people calling me ""dumb, stupid, idiot"" and because of that, i have always kinda thought that it would be okay to treat others that way. throughout our relationship, me and Bf joked to each other and i've always naively used those negative words; even making fun of the things he likes and loves. i constantly remind him to tell me if i have gone too far. to me it was all jokes, but in self reflection.. i think that i hurt him.. i'm not sure but that's what i believe.

I love my parents, but they are incredibly childish, and have very erratic emotions.  They have been through a lot, and so have I. 

Lately, I (m14) am noticing some specific behaviours and things they do. They like to judge me on things like telling them I don‚Äôt want to go to church, or talking with my brother about things to do with church. They always say something negative about me. And they seem to care about me most when doing things that I thrive in and are most likely to bring me success. 

Tonight, I was talking them about Narnia, as it was recommended as a watch next after the new Percy Jackson show. I searched up what the witches name was cause we were wondering and then my parents started to talk to me about the books, and how I‚Äôd really like them. 

(I‚Äôm not a huge reader as I have an over active adhd brain and am dyslexic, so I find it very hard. They know this, but keep putting books on my desk and talking to me about a book I started to read but then stopped because I found it to be too much.) 

They started noting things I and my generation do, like reading reviews and not actually watching or reading things. I was feeling upset because they sounded like they were attacking me. I got up and said I needed to sleep and they stopped me to tell me I often find things impossible because of my anxiety. 

They then said I have done many awesome things this year, and that if I learnt that skill of doing scary and overwhelming things I would be perfect.

 (They always say that. If I learn piano I would be perfect. If I do this I will be perfect.) 

They said they endorse and invest in things to get me to succeed.

I‚Äôm just so angry and frustrated that I have to deal with this pain on top of everything else I‚Äôm feeling. It feels like I‚Äôm stuck in this cycle and I don‚Äôt know how to get out of it.

We all try to support each other as best we can but our group hasn't been able to get together as much because of conflicting schedules. 

The friend who now has depression hasn't been working on things they normally do and for some dumb reason my brain has stuck onto the idea that they're doing terribly. Which I've actually heard they're doing better from their husband and from their mouth. They're now on antidepressants that have helped them immensely. But still my brain CANNOT let go of the idea that they are drowning in their depression or on the verge of doing something drastic. Which I frankly don't have any evidence for. They have talked about their future with me mutiple times but any joke or negative connotation is met with immense overwhelming anxiety in my mind.

My brain constantly thinks about them and how they're doing bad and how they're gonna do this and I don't wanna deal with another tragedy in my life and and and... it's been causing me an insurmountable amount of anxiety. I've tried deep breathing, hanging out with them, checking on them, mediation, journaling, talking to others about it, distracting myself and more but STILL.... the stupid anxiety of it will. Not.

Hello, everyone! I need your help. 

Brief info: me and my fianc√© have been together for 3 years and have been knowing each other for 5 years .

Recently he has pushed me away saying that he feels nothing at all towards everything and wants nothing. He says that he feels cold and emptiness inside and he doesn‚Äôt want to have any relationships anymore. He asks me to leave him and refuses to listen, says he wants to be all alone. I am confused now. When he was a teen, he was diagnosed with a schizotypal personality disorder. We are both F21 and M 22. He used to take some medication right after he was diagnosed but then he stopped as that medication had a negative effect on him. I read that social isolation is a typical symptom of this disorder. For your understanding, I witnessed when he had derealisation a couple of times and I know that he had a period once in his life when he cut all his connections. Since the beginning of our story this is the first time when he tries to distance himself like this. Right now he says that the reason why his feelings towards everything including me have disappeared is somewhere deep inside him. I suppose such depressive(?) episode is rooted in his disorder. Also, the last 3 months weren‚Äôt easy for him. I think that there‚Äôs my fault too. So maybe it‚Äôs also like an emotional burnout or something. He says he‚Äôs better off alone and he‚Äôs empty. Says ‚Äúit‚Äôs easier if you leave me‚Äù. I feel like he doesn‚Äôt want to be seen in such condition and that he thinks that he‚Äôll ruin everything bc he is cold rn. 

I love him so much. I want to be with him. He‚Äôs the love of my life and I really want to help him. For now, I have decided to stop bothering him for a while and let him spend some time alone but I‚Äôm very worried. I know that he won‚Äôt agree to go to the psychiatrist  at the moment and I don‚Äôt want to pressure him.  He doesn‚Äôt want to talk and see me at all. 

So my questions are:
What can I do about it? How can I help him? I feel very confused right now. 

Thanks.

I've got it easy in life, however I'm very aware if this. I know others around me though are struggling and it hits home. My brother has had dept collectors round because he owes a lot of money for council tax (I wish I could help him)and I know the cost of living is very high. 

I live with my dad in a council house and I have quite cheap rent. Sure I have it easy but it isn't a nice feeling when this is pointed out as It just gives me dread. I don't know how long it will be easy for. I don't want to give you the numbers but before I asked my dad how much he has to pay for the bills and I started giving him half so I felt less anxious and that I was doing my bit. However after a discussion just now I've learned he is now paying a lot more. I have offered to give him more but he says he's ok at the moment and doesn't need it. I know it sounds like a first world problem and I suppose it is but it just scares me. I can see struggle but I know right now I am spared it. I know my safety blanket is receding though and I just don't know if I'll cope when it's gone. 

I'm not skilled and I get paid minimum wage. I don't have kids so I think that will be a benefit but it's just hard to think about what life will be like when my dad goes. I don't want to be someone that just lives to work and works to live. To me that is the end of life. 

I don't want to be someone that works every day doing 50+ hours a week just to keep depts collectors at bay. That would break me. I feel like eventually I may end up ending it all. 

I'm happyish now but I couldn't be happy with that. I've also heard my dad has got health concerns which I'm scared to ask about. The whole thing is a lot to think about. Maybe I'm underestimating my ability to cope, it's just uncertainty right now. I do however save money which seems to not be the case for alot of people.

When i got to the UK, i changed. I wasnt a good student who studies well, scores well and my attendance was really bad. This kept going for 3 years (2024 summer). After failing to maintain a good result, i had to go back to Malaysia as my sponsor asked me to. Ever since that my relationship with my father has become so much worse.

While i was in the UK, i found a girlfriend (malaysian, not english) who i love very much. As i was doing worse and worse with my studies, it affected my relationship as i was under so much stress. When i had to come back to Malaysia because my sponsor asked me to, she started to become the least of my priorities. I was extremely occupied with dealing with my Sponsor and parents and i was very emotionally and physically exhausted but more so emotionally. I felt like ive extremely disappointed my parents and i felt worthless as a son. I wasnt available for my partner and i ended up ghosting her as i couldnt at all bring myself to be there for her. I was always exhausted from dealing with my sponsor and my parents. The whole time i ghosted her, the only thing that kept me going was the fact that i wanted to get things in my life back together before i go back to her because i became a very angry person whenever i was with her while this all was going on and i dont want that for her. she doesnt deserve to deal with an angry man. I am aware that my mistake of not communicating this to her was a big one but i couldnt bring myself to reach out to her as things were still messy and hectic on my end. in my head that seems like itll just slow down my progress which will delay me getting back on my feet and being able to be with her again.

3 months later, things are looking much better as i was getting full attendance for all my subjects in university, my results are improving so much more and i am scoring really well in my exams. I also got approved by my sponsor to continue my studies in Malaysia and things were looking to go well and I have finally managed to get my life back together. I decided to reach out to her because ive changed from being a loser and have changed things in my life for the better. But shes already moved on, and shes already starting to see someone else. I have never felt so hopeless in my life. I feel like the effort and work i put in the past 3/4 months have been completely useless.

My relationship with my dad is also not getting any better as he doesnt feel like ive changed. this makes me feel even more unseen and im really at the point of quitting and feeling like theres no point in trying anymore. it just feels like nothing is worth the effort as the effort ends up being unseen and worthless.

I am a seventeen year old girl, and I've been doing therapy since I was ten. I've always been incredibly sensitive and had severe generalized anxiety, so I've been taking medications for my anxiety and depressive symptoms since I was around eleven. Since then, I've been through countless therapists, and over 9 medications over the course of my life to calm down my treatment resistant issues. And yet, I continue to struggle.

I am currently in online schooling. Due to intense school refusal/school avoidance in previous years, as well as my agoraphobia, in-person schooling is practically impossible for me. When I would try going, I would have panic attacks. Almost daily, I tried and tried again to even just get myself out the door, as I really wanted (and still do) to go to school. But it wasn't at any avail. Because of this, I'm still a sophomore in high school, as I've missed an entire year due to this.

I hadn't been able to attend my online school which started September of 2024 until last month, where I only attend one class 3 days a week. And yet, the symptoms that were present in person still exist online. I feel as I do not feel safe anywhere anymore.

I've tried CBT, DBT, EMDR, Art Therapy, Somatic Therapy, basically everything that's been available to me. And yet, nothing.

Because of all this, I'm accepting that at the moment, there's no hope for my life at the moment. I am in no way suicidal, but I would like to hear from other people who have reached a point in their lives of no hope of their futures, and how they have dealt with it, as I'm struggling to grapple with the reality that until further notice, there's not much that can be done.

Thank you for reading my post. I kindly ask that if you decide to reply to me, to not claim that it will get better, or anything along the lines of that. It's a hope that I've tried to have my entire life, and I'm seeking advice for accepting that there is currently no hope. Thanks.",hopeless

My passport is stuck in limbo because i was stupid enough to think i had time and i didn't have all my required documents anyway. I submitted it to be renewed with the proper gender and i don't think i'm going to get it back with the right gender. it's going to suck. i'm going to have mismatching genders on various documents, and i'm scared i'll get flagged when I try to travel. i have summer plans to study abroad and i don't know if i'm going to be able to do that. Even if I get my passport back no one in Europe is going to want anything to do with Americans by the summer. what's the fucking point? when the earth is on fire and everyone is a fascist and members of my own fucking family want my kind dead? i'm about to start T injections instead of the gel, because i want to be able to stockpile it, but there's a shortage and i'm scared about being able to get as much as I need. let alone the money it's going to take to get a study abroad flight and I don't want to put that burden on my family.

1j782rr,"How to tell your parents you‚Äôre feeling suicidal, without overwhelming them",MentalHealthSupport,1741528356.0,1,1,"Hello friends, so I‚Äôm a (23M) and I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety and depression for the past 8-10 years. I‚Äôve had active suicidal thoughts at times the past 5 years. 

The closest I ever came to following through with these thoughts by overdosing was in my 3rd year of university about 3-4 years ago. I remember being my bedroom of the rented room I got for school and I was sitting in my chair having a mental breakdown from being overwhelmed by a new environment (This was my 3rd year at school, but my 2nd year was all online because of Covid 19, so I was at home). I remember my anxiety was so bad that I wouldn‚Äôt want to go upstairs to make food in our houses shared kitchen since I was socially anxious about interacting with the 3 other guys that lived upstairs. So I was almost starving myself at times (They were all great guys btw, my anxiety was just really really bad), was also really worried about finding my classes and not being late (Like every other student), also had multiple assignments that I just felt super overwhelmed with, wasn‚Äôt getting hardly any sleep either. I remember being up until 3-4am most nights just sitting in bed staring into nothing and having rapid thoughts going through my mind about all kinds of things. Majority of them about how I am a failure, I won‚Äôt be able to do the normal tasks that people can do, you know those negative kind of thoughts.

So I remember that day I cameback from class after worrying all night about missing the bus and not finding my classes. I just sat down in my chair and just broke down. I just couldn‚Äôt control it at all, felt my body just getting very achy, started to get a pounding headache, was almost hyperventilating it seemed and I went into my closet and grabbed a bottle of Advil. I just waved it around for a bit and just thought how easy it would be to just not have to deal with any of it. I remember I opened the bottle and grabbed a pill out and just was almost idolized it. I just didn‚Äôt want to deal with any of
It anymore and in that moment I remember the usual thoughts of ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it, you will hurt the people around you, they will suffer long after you‚Äôre gone‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do that to your family & friends‚Äù. Which were the usual thoughts I would have when my suicidal thoughts got really bad, since I don‚Äôt want to hurt the people around me and I truly believe that‚Äôs always been the reason I never went through with any of my suicidal intentions. Because if I didn‚Äôt have great people in my life that cared about me, I would have been gone years ago. Like I have heard stories about people not going through with it, because they are afraid of death & what comes after. But for me I was not afraid of that, I just wanted to be free. So while all that is going on, that sameday I just happened to have a scheduled appointment call with my schools therapist and I also think that call saved my life since it was just nice in that moment to have someone to talk with and I remember telling her I was holding that bottle of Advil and all thoughts I was having. She was amazing, she listened to everything I was trying to say at the time and just convinced me all these feelings will pass (And they did). 

So that was my closest suicidal moment, since then I‚Äôve had similar moments at times in my life (But not to that point again) and I‚Äôm in a similar suicidal thoughts period right now it seems. Over the past week I‚Äôve had 2 breakdowns, 1 passed pretty quickly and wasn‚Äôt too bad to deal with. The other I remember being in the bathroom getting ready for a shower and it just hit me, all the thoughts of not being able to find a job in Canada in the field I studied for or get any kind of job for that matter, was going to get a haircut that day with a friend as well and I was anxious about that, not being able to find my partner in crime throughout all my 23 years on this planet, thoughts of going back to school for another program, thoughts of my parents thinking I‚Äôm a failure and me thinking I am letting them down by not moving forward with my life. While the people I grew up with have been moving forward. I just remember having those same physical symptoms that I had before when I was the closest to taking my life and this episode lasted about 15-25min. I remember trying to ground myself by sitting on the floor or trying any of the techniques I‚Äôve learned over the years and nothing worked. But I just let time do its thing and I was okay after those 15-25min once I got it all out of my system. 

My parents have started to notice since I‚Äôm just acting different I guess (Not in a bad way to them) but I‚Äôm just being more to myself and lying in bed more often.

All this to say, I told my mom I would tell her what‚Äôs going on when she gets back from her trip, since she came into my room before she left saying I could tell her anything and she wouldn‚Äôt be upset with me. I just have no idea how to go about telling my parents something this big without scaring them and I don‚Äôt want to do that. Since everyone in my life has always seen me as a happy & always smiling individual. Like I know suicidal thoughts is a very big deal, but again like I‚Äôm sure a lot of others are that deal with this stuff. You don‚Äôt want to become a burden to those you share these mental health struggles with.

Would love to know others experiences with telling their parents or loved ones about these heavy topics and how they went about it. Thanks in advance for all the advice and thanks for reading, hope you have a fantastic day!",overwhelmed

She refuses to accept it, and basically pretends her dad is ""on vacation"" I can't even say ""Dad"" around her (when referring to my own father) without her suddenly becoming emotional. This whole ordeal is taking a toll on my sister as well since they are both married and live together.

She becomes the most emotional and angry when she drinks, and then basically verbally attacks our whole family because she felt we were not there for her when her father passed.

Just recently, she spoke out again about not wanting to be here (living), and she wants to be with her father, and she feels her life is worth nothing, and that she has no one in her life. Her mom is a drug addict, so they don't talk that much, but she is also constantly telling us she is ""not crazy"" and it's ""not the alcohol"" whenever she goes off about this whole situation when she's drinking. So yes, there's some denial going on within her as well.

Neither me nor my sister know what to do about this because you can't force someone to seek professional help if they are not willing, and so my sister has learned to just put up with her emotions regardless of how my sister-in-law acts, but this is not fair for her.

I'll start off by saying English is not my main language. This doesn't mean I don't write/speak it well. (I'm Italian)

I'm female, 19.
I made a post previously about something hygiene related and people keep telling me I may be depressed, have ADHD and others. So this led me to wanting to post about my mental struggles here. 

I'll just paste here what I wrote before on the other post:

I think I feel overwhelmed all the time. So much I just take my phone to get my mind to relax and end up wasting time, while at the same time I'm stressing over the things I should be doing. But I just can't start. 

Sometimes I tell myself to wait, write down what I need to do, even the stupidest thing like ""Put on the sweater"", tidy up my desk a bit or break down bigger tasks into smaller ones. It helps but sometimes even this is not enough to get me started. 
I internally start the task of ""checking off my to-do list"" but most of the time I get interrupted: my mom calling for me, family needs to go out.. just external factors, even sounds or whatever that distracts me. And when I go off the road of my ""checking off my to-do list"" task, it takes me a lot of energy to go back to it. Often I can't, I just go back to doom scrolling or doing something else completely, that is not in my to do list.

This has been a problem ever since I was 11-12. 
I always felt paralyzed, frozen as time was literally flying past me. Made me think that no matter how much I ran, I couldn't reach it. There is no point. So I just sit still, looking at the screen.
Even if my mind is going crazy, reminding me, telling me to get started, to just move. ""It's pointless"". ""I'm not gonna get all these things done, so why bother?"". ""I barely know how to start this, why try? It won't be good enough."" 
Even if thirty minutes, an hour, two hours go by, I just don't get started. I feel like the biggest procrastinator bc instead of actually doing things, I'm just watching a video which may also be productivity related. Ironic
At the end, the whole afternoon passed and I haven't done shit. I feel bad. I stress over all this and to protect myself, I cover these thoughts by looking at videos again or playing games. Need that dopamine to survive yk?

This is what I'm currently aware of. Idk if my head tries not to think about this by being with friends or doing something that benefits me, but it's not lived as it should. I'm not sure

Plus the current world situation doesn't help. I really feel like truthfully there's no point in anything at this point.

I don't know how to help myself. I'll do my best to get in contact with a therapist. I really would like to know if there's a name to this. Something to address it.

I can't enjoy things. I can't feel good about myself.

I've been living in my first apartment since about August of last year and it has been one of the most challenging experiences of my life. I recently finished grad school just to say I was done with it and got my degree. However I was so burnt out by that field and just saw the worst of it that I never want to work in that field ever again. 

That said I went to work for a company doing something completely different and while I enjoy the job for the most part I'm just burnt out by the amount of mileage I rack up every day and just burnt out by my colleagues and just it not being exactly what I want it to be. Along with that basically I live in a town where I've never felt wanted ever in my life and I have no social life I don't have any friends really and I'm painfully alone to the point where sometimes weekends turn into hitting the bottle pretty hard because my grad school was a very heavy drinking culture. 

Then to make matters worse there's just a lot of anxieties left right and Center due to my life and how work is going. Just tonight I discovered that my car can be unlocked from my apartment which is literally a few floors above where my car is and that scares The living daylights out of me because I've had my car broken into twice in the four months I've been here and I'm beginning to worry I could have accidentally caused it. 

I know it's not my fault but learning this scares me that I can unlock my car from my apartment and now I got to ensure every night before I go to bed I hit the lock a few times. That guy still want to go down there and check it but I know it's fine cuz I hit the button a few times.

Hi, I‚Äôm Ambrose, new here btw sorry if i do/say something wrong. TW: suicide ‚ö†Ô∏è
I‚Äôm a 19ftm and i struggle recently, for now 3 years i successfully have been ‚Äòsober‚Äô from any kind of overwhelming struggle or unhealthy thoughts. But it‚Äôs starting again. 
(sorry it‚Äôs a lot of paragraphs)

I want to attempt but fail it on purpose as a wake up call for my parents, to show them that i need to be taken seriously, it feels like the only solution. But at the same time i know they‚Äôll think i attempted for some stupid reason because they don‚Äôt know i bottle it all up, and they won‚Äôt understand.
Being unable to talk to a therapist makes it even worse, i barely can journal my feelings and worries (somehow when it‚Äôs in english it‚Äôs fine but not my mother tongue), i just feel so pathetic and i sob feeling like i need to tear myself to sheds for just saying i feel bad. 

N.B. I know I have issues, and I am ashamed to still be at my mother‚Äôs house at 19, ashamed of my hygiene, ashamed that i can‚Äôt do basic things like paperwork, etc. I feel like a whining asshole who expect to have everything on a silver platter. And I know that‚Äôs how my mother views me, when at the same time she expects the same, she expects that i know how to do everything as if I did taxes for 40 years, have a wife and two kids. It also hurt to see she‚Äôs pampering my step brother for issues we have in common. Yet he is a cis guy and I‚Äôm not, she got him numerous doctors like psychiatrists, occupational therapist, speech therapist, special help in class,‚Ä¶ for what you may ask? ADD. So okay it‚Äôs great for him, but what did I get to help with my ADD? nothing. just blame and contempt since childhood.

And I just feel helpless and overwhelmed. I know it‚Äôs bad and I maybe sound like a coward saying that at any conflict whatsoever the only solution that pops up in my head is to end it all.. but i don‚Äôt want to, i want to live, but i can‚Äôt continue like that. 

The pressure from my mother, the pressure of uni (which i might get expelled for not passing two damn exams), the dysphoria, the loneliness, my only friend leaving the city to live with her bf she met a month ago, my poor hygiene that i KNOW will get better as soon as i leave the damn family house, pressure from paperwork i didn‚Äôt filled yet, the pressure from my ADD brain making me unable to do simple tasks, the fact that i‚Äôm in uni for a career i don‚Äôt want to do when 5 months ago i thought i‚Äôd never get accepted (which i feel guilty about it, i‚Äôll elaborate if needed), feeling unlovable, +10 years old grief I still haven‚Äôt gone over, an aching baby fever i might add, struggling with responsibilities bc i fear conflict,‚Ä¶",overwhelmed

I feel like things will never get better because they depend on me to do so. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone in my life about this, either, so I don't have a lot of support when I need it. My coping skills when I get into this place are almost non-existent. My counselor and others tell me to breathe deeply or challenge my harmful thoughts, but none of that feels like it helps. The thoughts and this feeling always stay with me. I don't know what would make my situation better. I don't know how to become a more stable person who can deal with making mistakes or feeling overwhelmed without getting to the point where I hate myself because of outside issues. I honestly think I might never get better, and I'm just begging for anyone to help me.",worthless
1i1s0lg,feeling abandoned and worthless,MentalHealthSupport,1736924976.0,0,1,"me (22f) and my little sister (21f) are extremely close. she's my best friend, and we do everything together. I guess you could say a good part of this closeness comes from our family dynamic. our dad is emotionally abusive, an alcoholic, and a narcissist. so our whole lives, we've only had each other. our mom doesn't stand up to our dad, and it's just a shitty situation overall. for the last year or so, my sister and I hav been planning to move out together. it's always been a sort of far out dream, but we've wanted to make it happen. we both hate our dad and our home environment so badly, and it's killing both of us to keep living here. the issue is this: I go to university full time, and don't have the time to work full time to save up enough to move out any time within the next year or so. my sister on the other hand doesn't go to school, has been working full time since she graduated high school, and has the money to move out. lately she's been making little comments about moving in with two of her coworkers/friends this summer, and it's making me fall apart. I feel like I'm being abandoned, and like I'm not a good enough reason for her to stay here with me until I can also afford to move out. we had a plan to go together, and now she's changing the plan. it hurts that she'd choose her coworkers over me, no matter how good of friends they are. she knows how I feel about our dad and our home, and yet she's still choosing to leave me here alone. I hate her for planning to leave soon, but I'm also so glad she's getting out while she can. I brought this up to her yesterday and cried the whole time, and haven't stopped since. I feel like I shouldn't have told her how upset and betrayed this whole thing makes me feel, because now it feels awkward between us and I'm starting to avoid her. my mind is telling me to stay away so that it'll hurt less when she actually does leave, but I know if I do that I'll lose out on so many great moments with her. and now that I've brought it up, I know that if she decides to stay, it'll only because she feels guilty leaving me. I don't want her to stay out of pity, I want her to stay because she wants to and because she loves me. everything is just a mess now. and I can't talk about it with our mom because she doesn't know how much I hate and am scared of my dad. it'll bring up even more drama and I can't handle that right now. I just don't know what to do. I don't want to lose my sister. she's the only reason I have in the world to keep going, and I honestly don't think I can do this without her. ",worthless
1i0vni3,I feel like im worthless,MentalHealthSupport,1736821458.0,0,1,"I feel like im worthless and i will never ammount to anything

I had my first class of my second semester of college today and it was statisic's and i mentioned to my dad how it seemed like it was going to me tuff

That lead into my dad telling me ""well maybe if you put in the effort and actually tried"" and stuff like that which he has been saying to me most of my life and started this huge argument

I have never been the best student, i did summer school all of my life except senior year even though i tried my best, but last semester was the first time i passed all my classes with out anyone bailing me out and i was so proud of myself, but now i realize that was just luck, that it means nothing, im still the same dumb worthless idoet i have always been

Worst part is no matter what i do im worthless, I have given up on my dreams to be a lawyer becuse im to stupid and my dad wont pay for my other dream when it comes to college since he doesnt think it will give me a good life so even if i keep going to college it will just show how stupid and worthless i am and that nothing i like or any dreams i want would come from going to college anymore

But on the same end if i dont go to college i will be worthless, a loser who never finished school who has no way to get a good job and will be living out of a trailer like a worthless nobody

No matter the path i see all i can think is one thing, at the end of this path i will be worthless, nothing good will come from it, nothing, I will just be worthless, i have thought this way countless times and every time i think im finally improving, it fucking comes back stronger and im reminded just how worthless i am

Secondly I'm only ranting here because I feel like I have no one to talk about this shit with irl so yea. I'm 17(M) and Every person in my life just seems fake and it's been a thing since I was about 10 where i have this gut feeling that my friend or friends don't like me and are only friends with me because I think they're my friends and they don't have the balls to say otherwise. And while this could just been seen as a thing in the back of my mind but it's just been proven again and again and again where all my friends no matter how real they seem in the end have hated me and now I'm left with no one and struggling to find a purpose in life. It's happend 3/4 times atleast in the last 4/5 years and everytime I think I've found people who actually like me for me it just isn't real like even yesterday I was out with one of my best friends who then doesn't even reply to me for over a day without any warning and I just think that's another close friend lost for nothing and with no explanation and it's just making me think the world would be better without me and it's my fault this happens over and over again even if I really haven't done or said anything to warrant this. The example I gave for yesterday is perfect for that as we were litteraly best friends for months and nothing was going wrong and we had both acknowledged that but suddenly they don't want to speak to me anymore and just ignore me. Just in general it feels like I have to force people to be my friends and I now feel like it's because I'm a shitty waste of space who would be better off dead. Not just with my friends but my ex girlfriend of 2 years who for the most of the relationship I was deeply in love with and thought she felt the same and she said it many many times, eventually became more focused on ruining my life and controlling every aspect of my life, she made me lose friends I had for years cuz she didn't get along with them or just thought they might influence me to leave her. It was a real struggle to break up with her but ever since this rs I have really felt certainty over the fact that I am a waste of time and space on this earth.I really have more I could say in general about how I feel but I just want someone to try help me understand why this happens everytime I think someone actually likes me.",worthless

I often feel like people don‚Äôt take me seriously because of my childish humor and personality (I‚Äôm 20 years old). I'm not as much as insecure about my personality as compared to my looks, but people treat you differently so I sometimes hide who I really am, and it bothers me.

I‚Äôm worried about my appearance and whether it‚Äôs affecting how people see me. I am constantly aware of what my hair is looking like in the middle of a conversation or other features of my face. I compare my appearance and my achievements with people on social media. These are mostly people my age and my friends sometimes. Seeing them enjoying life makes me sad.

I have friends and different friend circles, but I don't feel a connection with them sometimes. Some friend groups make me feel like the filler friend. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt speak and stay quietly in the corner while hanging out with people. It‚Äôs the opposite‚ÄîI‚Äôm the one cracking jokes and lifting up the mood of the hangout. People laugh at the things I say, which makes me feel good. The things I say sometimes get self-deprecating but not always. I don't know if I'm even doing this for feeling good about myself or if this is the real me.

I‚Äôm also feeling a strong desire to have sex and a girlfriend, but I‚Äôm currently single and struggling with these feelings. I've had a girlfriend once, but it didn‚Äôt work out, which was a couple of months ago. This, however, makes me insecure about everything I am. I‚Äôve even been thinking about prostitutes as a way to address my desires.

I‚Äôve started getting high all the time from smoking weed, and I often masturbate while high and watching porn. This is starting to get worse for the past few weeks. I‚Äôm starting to worry about my health and well-being.

I‚Äôve been going to the gym for the past 3 months to try to improve myself. Avoided listening to sad songs. Joined an internship program to be engaged in my work but time just seem to pass by while I feel lonely and worthless.

1ipg32c,A list of (mostly) everything I have to deal with,MentalHealthSupport,1739554612.0,7,3,"Sorry, this is gonna be long.

HIGH SCHOOL:

Not as bad or as difficult as it could be, but still adds more stress to my life. Not super boring, not super fun. The main issue is my first class, which is a college class. We meet every Thursday and you're expected to read a digital textbook and complete an assignment by the following Wednesday. The problem is it's difficult to keep up with, you can't turn in work after the deadline, and I don't do work till nearing the deadline and I can't do work at home (elaborated on further below), so I've missed most assignments. Most of the time I'm exhausted when I get home.

MENTAL HEALTH:

‚Ä¢ ADHD: This is the reason why I can't do schoolwork unless I'm at school. Executive dysfunction makes it to where I can't shower unless my parents aren't home, I can't brush my teeth, I can't exercise, I can't wash my hands (there are a few exceptions), I can't wear underwear, it makes it practically impossible to stay hygienic. Then there's the overstimulation, which makes everything I'm dealing with harder to deal with. Medicine only helps so much, actually have an appointment about it Monday. I'm always seeking dopamine, don't get it often. It's actually why I hate weekends, got nothing to do. This makes me bored which then increases my anxiety (elaborated below).

‚Ä¢ OCD: ADHD's right hand man, as it turns out. This increases my anxiety when I'm bored, since I have nothing to distract me. Part of why I can't shower unless my parents aren't home. People look at me like I'm crazy when I touch things a specific way, or type in a weird pattern, or leave the bathroom immediately after flushing (part of why I don't wash my hands). If I'm in a public restroom and flush a toilet, I have to plug my ears, not because it's loud but because OCD. Intrusive thoughts galore, it's often difficult to tell if a violent thought is intrusive because I usually feel happier with those thoughts. I also have a habit of nail biting, both finger and toe, and pulling my hair. The nail biting has disfigured my nails, often times there's dried blood in them. Since I rarely wash my hands, biting my nails spreads hundreds of germs to things I touch.

‚Ä¢ Autism: Not gonna elaborate on this too much since it's similar to ADHD and I'm not entirely sure I have it. I was diagnosed when I was in elementary, the diagnosis was changed to ADHD in mid 2022. Pretty likely I have it since my brother is autistic and over half of people with ADHD also have autism.

‚Ä¢ Depression: A result of ADHD and OCD. Especially with everything going on right now, I've been feeling more and more hopeless day after day. Idk if it's because I'm so exhausted after school, but I've been more tired recently. Antidepressants worked in the past, I can't tell if they're still working.

‚Ä¢ Entertainment: My controller broke last week and I'm supposed to be getting a new one next week. Until then, I have to rely on YouTube, Reddit, music, and Balatro. Nothing new on YouTube, lot's of politics on Reddit (elaborated later), only so much entertainment from music, and Balatro is slowly becoming boring. It feels like everyday is the same, especially since I can't use my Playstation till next week.

‚Ä¢ Identity: Never thought I'd question my sexuality and gender, but here we are. I stopped caring about dating and sex when I realized that I don't understand women. I have nothing against them, I just don't get them. I understand men, because I am one; we have the same hormones. I'm attracted to women, but only physically, as I can't understand them mentally. After that realization, I've identified as aroace. However, after seeing some lesbian porn (no seriously), I asked myself, ""What if I was a girl? Then I'd be attracted to women both physically and mentally"". It's led to a lot of introspection and research, and I hate to say it, but I'm too scared to transition. I mean I have a deep voice, I'm 6 foot tall, super hairy, enjoy what people consider masculine things. I've seen some incredible transitions, but it doesn't look amazing immediately. I tried looking more feminine one night, but it was so embarrassing even though no one else saw me. It's also too dangerous to transition right now (all because of that orange bastard), too costly, and my parents wouldn't support it. Recently I questioned if I was agender after discovering that gender has no use anymore. For any kind of document, I list my gender as ""prefer not to say"". If it's not there, I put ""male"".

Somewhat related to the above, my dad wants me to start going to church, but I'm agnostic-atheist. I've been agnostic-atheist since sophomore year and I am content with my belief. My dad does not know that, he thinks I'm Christian. Thankfully he's smart enough to respect my beliefs and he said he'll always support me no matter my beliefs. That doesn't stop me from being afraid of telling him that I'm atheist though.

‚Ä¢ Politics: This is the one thing that is worrying me the most. Not gonna go too deep into it, all I'm gonna say is there's a demented tangerine in office butchering the government and making a laughing stock of the US. Sic semper tyrannis.

PHYSICAL HEALTH:

‚Ä¢ Temperature: I get extremely hot extremely easily. I get so hot that I refuse to wear pants and coats no matter the temp. I have a small room with 2 machines running, bad AC, and an old fan. Without that fan, in Fall, my room is nearly 100F¬∞, seriously, I checked. This causes me to sweat a lot thus making me smell bad and feel bad, which brings me to my next issue.

‚Ä¢ Showering: I try to shower at least twice a week, usually 3 times a week. I used to only be able to shower every other day, but I've been trying to shower more often. Remember, I can only shower if both of my parents aren't home. They can't just drive around either, they have to have a purpose for going out other than letting me shower. Since I don't wear underwear, am fat, and sweat a lot, it doesn't do as much as I'd hoped for. The clammy wet skin and coldness after showering also sucks.

‚Ä¢ Teeth: I can't brush my teeth. I haven't brushed my teeth in maybe half a year. I've had 2 or 3 cavities either removed or filled in the past few years. The only way I can kinda brush them is via a dry washcloth, which even then I don't do often. I can't deal with the gritty teeth, shitty flavor, and the inedible properties of toothpaste. Guess what? After finding a toothpaste that actually works, I still can't use it. I see videos of massive chunks of calculus being removed by dentists and the only think I can think of is ""that's gonna be me"". I primarily drink soda and milk, and I primarily eat potato chips, pizza, fast food, and vegan meat. This brings me to my next issue.

‚Ä¢ Obesity: I'm roughly 6 feet tall and weigh roughly 280 pounds at 17 years old, which makes me obese. Idgaf what others think of my weight, I don't think my obesity makes me ugly. I do think it makes me unhealthy though. I buy ice cream and fries at McDonald's at least once a week, often twice a week. I've tried quitting soda, tried quitting potato chips, and I've done neither. Sun Drop has been my favorite drink since I could walk. However, I've made a very big step that I am pretty proud of; I quit caffeine. Now I drink caffeine free Coke. Still extremely unhealthy, but hey, it's something. I also don't drink water, the only situation where I'd drink water is if I'm extremely thirsty and there's nothing else available. Extremely cold water is nice, but I can't get it extremely cold very fast. I don't eat much, usually 1 or 2 meals a day and sone snacks if I'm still hungry. Since I get so hot and exhausted, I don't exercise. I think eating meat is healthier than not eating meat, but I'm vegetarian.

‚Ä¢ Eyes: This has 2 parts to it; strain and sight. Given that I stare at a screen for like 10 hours a day, I often get eye strain and twitches. The former is a bad headache that makes me tired, the latter makes me want to rip my eyes out. My light is always off in my room and I usually have 2 screens on 24/7. I use blue light filter and dim the brightness, but still get strain and twitches. Although I eventually got used to it, the strain has been affecting me recently since I've been looking at my phone a lot more because I can't use my Playstation. Last night was the worst it's been, I could barely keep my eyes open and pretty much fell asleep as soon as I got home. Acetaminophen is hit or miss, ibuprofen doesn't work. Now onto sight. My left eye has a tendency to drift to the left (happening as I'm typing, weirdly makes it easier to see, can't remember the name for it), i have astigmatism (lights give off spiky glares), and i have trouble seeing far away. I have glasses but I don't use them. Tried contacts, but anything that touches my eyes immediately makes them shut tight. My sight isn't that bad, just makes me sad when I can't see Kahoot answers lol.

‚Ä¢ Neck: Looking down at my MacBook and phone all day puts a lot of strain on the back of my neck. Not too bad, but definitely makes my neck achy, hurts in the evening.

‚Ä¢ Nausea: Since I've been more anxious recently, my stomach has been more sensitive than usual and it's ached more than usual. I drink a lot of milk too and I'm lactose-intolerant, it's too good not to drink. I usually don't have bathroom issues though, so that's nice. Combined with eye strain it feels like torture. 

‚Ä¢ Hand Washing: I will only wash my hands if I get something sticky/slimy on them, I'm about to prepare food in culinary class, or during a shower. No, I do not wash them after wiping my ass (assuming I don't get shit on them). I try to use hand sanitizer as much as I can, but I often forget. 

There's probably more to the health section, but let's move on.

FINANCES:

Food and household stuff? 100$ a week. Gas? Idk, but probably quite a bit. Bills? Don't ask. Medicine? $200 a month. Subscriptions? An embarrassing amount. It may not seem like a lot, but my parents combined make roughly $50k and live paycheck to paycheck. Even with my mom getting a second job we struggle. We still have to file an insurance claim on our driveway because Hurricane Helene turned the bottom of it into a rally track. No way I'm getting a job soon, there's way too much on my plate already.

COLLEGE:

Jfc. I have to fill out scholarships, keep up with FAFSA, file for housing, go to the open house, schedule a tour, buy essentials, qualify for a solo dorm (I can't have a roommate under any circumstances), and i need to get thousands of dollars, all with the very real chance that I'll fail, drop out, or deal with even more anxiety when I'm in college. I'm scared of being independent. Without saying my goal, it can take several years to be qualified enough to work at my dream job, and will cost tens of thousands of dollars with the ONLY opportunity to pass. 

DOGS:

I have 2 very cute dogs; Bandit and Cedar. They're both collies, brother and sister, and I love them dearly. However, everytime I hear them bark, everytime I see them vomit, everytime I smell shit, I lose a small bit of the little sanity I have left. Cedars bark specifically has made me walk 2 football fields away from my house, and I could still vaguely hear it. Like I said, I love my dogs, but I'll be damned if I EVER get another dog again

No human has the ability to handle all of this at once without freaking tf out. I go to school, come back home exhausted, take my meds, shower if I can, go in my hot dark room, turn on the same youtube playlist I've been watching for weeks, eat vegan meat, play Hollow Knight if I could use my Playstation, scroll through Reddit, lose hope after seeing a news article about Trump, listen to music, and try to go to sleep, all while worrying about the future, trying to cope with my mental health, and getting more and more unhealthy as the day goes by.

Sorry for the extremely long post, I just had to put everything that causes me stress into a single post to get my head straight.

TL;DR: Everything is terrible.

1jrbsip,going into psychiatric care and feeling so scared,MentalHealthSupport,1743773053.0,0,1,"i (f19) have been going through a mental health crisis since around november last year. 
after a lot of discussion my parents and i decided that spending some time in a mental health facility would be super beneficial to getting me back on track. i haven't worked since january, and i can barely leave the house. it's been really hard lol.
my therapist, family, boyfriend, and friends are all very supportive and think that this is a good idea. i agree with them.
but im starting to freak out a bit.
it was my idea, because i haven't been this bad in years, and i haven't been coping well with just therapy. we've signed up for private health and im going into a private hospital, so im not overly stressed about the place/experience specifically...
the hospital is about an hour away from where i live, and i've never lived away from home before. it's a 21 day program, where i am allowed to go out during the day etc. it's voluntary admission so there are some benefits to that. 
i guess im just psyching myself out about it... i've turned my whole family's life upside down and i feel so terrible even though i know it's not something i can control.
i'm scared to not be down the hall to my parents, not have my dog with me, and be far away from my friends and boyfriend and just everyone. i have friends living in the city the hospital is in, but it's not my best friend. i have barely been able to see anyone except my best friend and boyfriend because i have been so nonfunctional.
i'm just so scared and i don't know how to ease my anxiety. i know it will be okay, but i can't shake this fear. i'm so close with my parents, and i know they'll visit, but it's going to be hard on everyone, not just me... im so scared and i feel so so guilty. i don't know what to do

1jhkele,Im obsessed with kurt cobain and i dont know what to do,MentalHealthSupport,1742682383.0,1,1,"sorry if this is formatted poorly or dosent make sense, im not in the best state right now and im on a new medication that makes me feel weird and believe odd things and im still getting used to it (to clarify this is not from the medication, as my infatuation with him started much before i started the medication) I 15F have an extensive history of mental health issues and trauma that ranges back to elementary school so this isnt that horrifying to come to terms with. I've been into grunge music for a decent amount of time, almost 2 years, however it was mostly the band hole and occasionally a few other artists. I never really had an interest in nirvana because it was really annoying that whenever i brought up that i liked hole and courtney love, my parents and others alive to experience the grunge scene always started schizophrenicly rambling about how courtney love is a heartless monster that murdered kurt cobain. My only experience with nirvana back then was hearing smells like teen spirit on the radio which i never really liked. However a couple months ago i decided to see what all the hype was about. I started listening to his songs more and more which  lead to me consuming more media surrounding nirvana, interviews with the band, videos of live shows, clips of him, etc. it was all pretty normal fan behavior. Then i saw the pictures. i think this is really when everything culminated and went downhill. Im autistic and ive had debilitating depression and anxiety as long as i can remember, ive just learned to live with it. i have a slight drug problem. it all kinda started when a little while ago, i wont talk abt what i took bc of rules but i ended up throwing up most of it before it could absorb into my blood. I think i only really got like a third of the actual dosages i took. anyway, in my totally fucked up state, i somehow ended up on youtube on my phone (i dont remember much past this and throwing up) and i ended up on a video of the images of kurt cobain's body that were released by the police in 2016. it changed me. this isnt the first time ive seen death, the images dont even show anything past his shoes and his hand and ive seen much more disturbing images and videos. but this sat with me. after i woke up and somehow collected myself the next morning i went back to the video. i cant stop watching it. i cant look away. this lead me down a rabbit hole into his suicide. i obsessively read his suicide note, look at the images, look at evidence, listen to the last song he played where he talks about shooting himself, watched interviews with courtney after his death, watched clips of him, wrote him letters. we are so similar, he talked about how nobody ever understood him and the world saw him as something he wasnt, i feel the exact same way. he talks about how he feels hes too sensitive like i do. we both use drugs to escape, i could go on and on about everything we have in common and everything amazing about him. hes like everything i am and everything i wish i could be at the same time. my entire life ive felt othered by everybody and its the first time ive ever seen anybody who feels the same way i do. i delusionally think that im the only one who understands him or that he can hear or see me somehow. i know this is silly and its not real. **i dont get any type of pleasure or satisfaction from watching this, i dont relish in his suffering and i really hope it dosent come across this way** whenever i go back to his music or the note or the pictures its extremely upsetting for me and i get extremely depressed, but i keep going back. i think i want some sort of comfort or closure or answer from these things that i never get. instead i always leave with the same lingering conclusion: **if somebody so similar to me, yet so beloved, someone that brought so much light to the world and so many people like me, someone that seemed like he had everybody rooting for him, still cant win, still suffer so much he cant bare to keep going, whats the point of me trying at all..? he was so great, so good and so beautiful inside and out. im nothing like him in that way. why should i even try? whats the point of staying alive.** im probably not going to kill myself. i never knew him but it feels like i do, i disgust myself. i grieve someone that never knew me. yet i feel like he can see me and i can see him. beyond death. no he dosent talk to me im not that fucking crazy. dont tell me im just immature and its some small crush on him, i dont even really like him that way, he was just so beautiful in every way like nobody ive ever seen before. im not some stupid kid that just sees someone they relate to for the first time. its so much more than that. i see him like nobody else did. im aware this is unhealthy and its not normal and its not the first time ive had delusions about things, when i was younger i thought the government had cameras in my computer and in my smoke detector. i used to hallucinate fairly frequently but it has mostly subsided for about a year. ive been hospitalized for it, i literally had to be at the absolute brink and go completely off the handle, ignoring school and my physical needs for it and still nobody took me seriously. i literally had screaming fits when i was in middle school where i just cried and cried and screamed and screamed if anybody got close to my room because i thought they were trying to hurt me. my parents handled this horribly and thought if they just screamed back that id be fixed. that worked as well as you could imagine. at the psych ward they told me it was anxiety and tried to give me some shitty ssris even though ive tried about every ssri and snri on the market and nothing has worked. i dont get them, maybe they think im a med seeker because i wasnt acting like an animal when i was in the hospital and around the doctors and nurses. anyway, kurt, i cant stop thinking about him, ive tried and tried, i stopped looking at the pictures and the note and listening to his music but i cant stop thinking about him. i dont know if im more obsessed with him or his death. i know its disgusting, but like i said i get no pleasure from thinking of his death. i think its a combination of some bizzare coping mechanism and desperately looking for closure and comfort. im not sure for what. that he didnt suffer? that hes not suffering anymore wherever he is in the afterlife? that it never happened? that its all fake and hes ok somewhere far away? that it really happened and its over? that if i do this i wont suffer anymore? maybe its everything. i cant grasp it, i never can. i never came to terms with it after my cousin molested me, i could probably never come to terms with something like this. i think im
looking for confirmation and closure that hes really gone but hes ok now because hes not in pain anymore. everybody else ignores me, i have barely any friends, ive spent my birthday alone or with my parents for the past 4 years. my boyfriend, 22m barely ever fucking talks to me, hes really sweet when he does but theres this constant lingering feeling like he just dosent care. hes in college and really busy so idk what to feel. dont even mention the age gap, thats not what im here to talk about and whatever your about to say about it i already know and have heard a thousand times before. ig it dosent matter bc i think about him about 100x less than i do kurt. he just dosent get me like he would. but im desprate for any affection, i stopped initiating it from my parents years ago. its not their fault, they have been through it all like me, and they love me as much as they are capable of, they are just as sick as me, but its almost worse because instead of constantly evolving and morphing, for better or for worse, like i do, they are completely stuck in their own ways. never changing, never getting worse but never getting better, well thats not completely true. with meditation my mom has gotten better over the years. my mom has bi polar disorder which heavily effected me as a child. i was stuck with her for the majority of it because my dad was in jail for beating her infront of me for most of it. he has npd and can never be wrong. ex con, multiple felon, drug charges, breaking and entering, violent crimes, the whole nine yards. he ""turned his life around"" and now makes a bunch of money hes racist now and has been clean for years but honestly id still take being stuck in that little warehouse with no bathroom door, a single matress and no furniture, malnourished and miserable while my mom tormented me as much as she loved me, a hundred times before id spend my childhood with my father. if i did id have probably killed myself way before id make it to this point. i still love both of them, i cant really fully blame them in a lot of ways they were sicker than i am. i dont know what to do with myself. i cant tell them. i cant ask for help, theyll put me back in the psych ward, treat me like an animal  and wont even help me. ill fail school if i go back. im already behind with a referall for not showing up to school because of my current state. the pills they gave me do nothing but make me worse. i need sedatives. i dont even want them to abuse them. i just want to feel ok. i genuinely get fits of anxiety so bad i cant sleep, cant move, cant talk, cant breathe. and they wont give me anything but fucking ssris that wont do anything. nothing works. a small amount of weed works but of theyd never give that to me for obvious reasons. i feel so stuck. i dont know what to do. this feels like the end but ive said that a hundred times before. they made me leave my best friend, it was probably for the best because that school environment degraded my health like acid eating through wood floors. but she was the only person who understood me even a fraction of what kurt cobain would. i feel like i cant live without her, and i guess im
not. i just hope i wake up and this was just a delusion from the meds, that im not really as sick as i am and that these new meds are just making me paranoid of something thats not real.

1j99j31,I need help. What is wrong with me??,MentalHealthSupport,1741748725.0,2,2,"I haven't posted on Reddit before and I don't really know where to start with this or what to include. I know I should be seeking support from a therapist but I can't access one at the moment. but I'll start with the issue that has lead me to be make this post... 

I am 21 Female. living at home with my parents and younger brother. For a long time now I have struggled getting out of bed in the morning and leaving my room when I can hear people in the house. It gives me severe anxiety and as soon as I emerge my room I instantly try not to make eye contact, get agitated waiting for them to speak to me and then become deeply frustrated when they do. It's to the point where I don't get out of bed until the afternoon when I realise I am never going to get a chance to get out of bed with no one home and the whole day is nearly gone or I have to get up for work or I'll be late. So every day I walk past as quickly as possible, give a quick hi with my head down if they talk to me and speed walk into the bathroom where I sit in the bottom of the  shower for an hour trying to pull myself together and also try to figure out why I am like this.

 Some mornings I can't push past it especically when I'm forced to talk more than my usual ""hi"". I try to get ready as quickly as possible and strategicly as possible to not have to make eye contact or speak with anyone but this is quite a hard task as my house only has 5 rooms and my dad is often sitting in the  room located right outside my bedroom door so by the time I leave the house I'm an anxious mess. I don't know why I feel this way. I haven't always been like this. There are alot of ideas I've come up with that could be contributing factors but none that feel like enough of a reason to behave like this. I feel like a piece of shit. I don't want to treat my parents this way. Especially my dad who is kind to me and is only trying to say good morning. 

A one theory I have is it that I am becoming non verbal in the morning which is a common trait of autism (which I am not diagnosed with but am sure I have// my brother was diagnosed severely autistic as a child and is partially non verbal. He is 20 years old now and has learnt to say a few sentences that make sense mixed with alot of gibberish phrases.) 

Second theory is it may have developed over the past few years... Before my dog Lilly, a  16year old english Staffordshire passed away in January she was old and suffering from cancer. Her whole life my brother had pestered her by sitting on her, pulling her ears and tail, pinching her but she was the sweetest thing and never fought back. I tried to defend her as much as possible, especially as she got older and developed a cancerous lesion on her tail which my brother wouldn't stop touching with dirty hands and making it  infected. He also often has tantrums and would run into my room  while me and Lilly were asleep in bed and try to pinch her or hurt her in some way so I learnt to constantly listen to everything as I sleep and spring up to defend lilly instantly whenever I heard footsteps near my room or hear my door open. I wonder if the habit of this contributes to why I lay there anxiously listening but it would only explain fear of my brother. 

My mother has meltdowns herself occasionally but never tries to hurt me not did she try to hurt Lilly when she was alive. She lives in a van now and comes and goes when she likes but when I was a child and she lived in the house with us she would wake up every day and start yelling, throwing things around and slamming doors usually because there was mess she didn't like (toys on the floor, dishes not done, laundry) so alot of my childhood was spent walking in egg shells. My mum was an alcoholic and spent all of her time either at the pub, throwing up in the bathroom or yelling at us for the house not being the way she wanted. 

My dad is an amazing man. He did everything for me and my brother growing up and still continues to now. He cares for my brother full time and would do anything for me but I still feel this resentment towards him and I don't understand why. In the morning he is the person I avoid the most (possibly because he is the hardest to avoid?)and I don't understand why. Maybe it's because of his judgmental nature. Often criticizing people who aren't as mentally strong as him and need drugs and alcohol to cope, calling them selfish (I personally use weed to cope with all I've been through in life. I experienced some quite traumatic event in my early teens. I was groomed by a 21 year old crackhead who I ended up living with for a year at age 13 who abused me in countless ways) 
My dad also palms me off when I try to tell him I think I'm autistic or have other mental health issues which makes it really hard to connect with him emotionally. 

As much as I feel I have answered my own question here I still don't feel satisfied with my answers. I feel like I'm just whinging. Why do I feel these emotions. I know my life isn't that bad and my dad is such as amazing man. He's done so much for me and I can tell he's worried about me since I've been so closed off and often breaking down into tears as I'm leaving home. I don't understand why I struggle to talk to him lately. Whenever I am home I just have this feeling inside me like I'm going to explode out of my skin. 

Sorry for the rant. any advice would be appreciated and please feel free to ask questions if I didn't explain something well",i cant cope
1jk0bxi,I fell inlove with idea of girl and it failed and now I'm in the worst spiral I've ever had,MentalHealthSupport,1742952657.0,0,1,"I'm 21, I have anxiety and OCD. I asked a girl out, we went on two dates. The dates went well. We were acquaintances beforehand. She said she was down to see each other again and offered to give me a hug at the end of the second date. The texting is what is driving me nuts. The two dates were right before spring break. She was only responding after 6 hours and at one point I asked her if she was free Sunday and only responded after two days and said ""Hey! I'm not free Sunday but I am later this week"" and I said ""Sounds good, let me know what day works for you."" 

It's been three days since I sent that and I haven't gotten any response. It's about to be that ""later in the week"" type thing. It's driving me insane. I know I'm young I know there are plenty of fish in the sea. I haven't asked someone out in almost two years and I fell inlove with an idea of a relationship with her because I am obsessive and I overthink. Other girls I have tried to have relationships where it didn't work was because I overwhelmed them for constant reassurance; and this is the one time I tried my absolute best to practice patience and give her space. My mental health has definitely been a cause of failed relationships and this is the one time I think I've done everything right. 

I can't access her thoughts, I don't want to double text, I want to give her space, and all these thoughts are stupid but I cannot control my emotions. 

I tried every coping mechanism I can but I don't have many close friends to distract myself from it and when I do my hobbies I think about her. 

Honestly this is the worst I've felt in so long. I've had to get with every resource possible. This is one of them. Please help me get some peace I can't get out of my head. ",i cant cope
1il0s8h,I'm so deeply unhappy,MentalHealthSupport,1739057110.0,5,9,"Hey y'all. Im currently living in a hotel room with my sister, nephew, and cat. I was planning on moving into a place with my best friend at the end of January but that fell through. I let my sister and nephew come live with me in a previous apartment a couple of years ago because they were homeless and she let him cause a ton of damage that I was charged over $1000 for. I couldn't pay it so it went to collections and I got denied at 2 different apartment complexes this time around because of it. My sister can't pay it because she refuses to get a decent paying job. 

I figured my best bet was to find a place being rented by the owner and before I found one I asked my friend if she was okay with living in an area about 20-30 mins from her job and she said she was. So I found a nice place being rented by a nice lady, sent my friend the address, the link to the listing and all of the fine details like when I was going to tour, what time and all. Only for her to say at the last minute after asking me how the tour went that she doesn't want to live in that area. Two days before I had to move out. She lives with her parents so she didn't have a time crunch or anything but she knew I did. I spent 13 hours moving my stuff into storage alone and had to use the last of my moving funds to get a hotel room.

So I texted my sister and asked if I could come stay with her (I'd pay half of course) only for my sister to tell me she lost her bs job and is sleeping in her car again. I felt awful that my nephew was in that situation again so I invited them to come stay in the hotel with me. I originally had the intention to get a room with two beds but it cost like $200 more and I can't afford it and she's not contributing financially because she's just doing a little online survey thing for money for food. So I'm sleeping on the floor.

I'm having the same issues i was when they lived with me before, she's not really parenting her son much. He peed the bed like two days ago and she still hasn't changed the sheets. It smells like piss in here and she lets him stomp around and make a ton of noise. I've told him to walk more lightly because it's rude to the people in the room below us but I gave up because she's not trying to reinforce it at all. There are crumbs and hardened clumps of food all over the counter, table, and floor. I had to tell my nephew to stop dropping food on the floor because my cat will eat it and I've seen her almost throwing up twice now in two days. My sister only says something after I do.

I was recently diagnosed with anxiety and adhd and all of this is making it worse. I've been crying at work, last year was really hard for me like I've been unintentionally distancing myself from my friends and not doing anything besides throwing myself into work. I was hoping to try to reconnect and start going out more but I feel like I'm frozen in place. I think I'm slipping into depression, everything feels so dull and hopeless. Music has always been an escape for me but even music has been sounding and feeling dull. I'm pushing back my online therapy sessions because they're here in the room with me and I don't want to talk about this stuff in front of them and whenever I think about just leaving the room for anything other than work I feel glued in place. I want to get an apartment before the end of the month but im draining my bank account every week just to stay in this hotel. I feel so down and im disgusted with myself because I can't bring myself to even look at or talk to my sister.

It's like I want to help them but I don't have the financial means and she's not doing anything to help her own situation. She's talking about wanting to homeschool my nephew and work from home and it's like she refuses to even entertain the option of doing anything but that. I just want to scream at her that she just doesn't have that option, she needs to put him in school she can get an actual job and get them their own place.

My dad has sent me some money to help but he's in a tight money situation right now. He wants me to let them live with me when I find a place just so they're not on the street but I refuse to put myself through that again. I feel like a terrible person but not having a place where I can just be alone actually makes me want to hurt myself, this whole situation does. Even just the sound of my nephew playing with his toys feels like I'm being beaten over the head. I think something is seriously wrong with me but I can't bring myself to kick them out on the street again.

And I just found out I may get laid off from my job in a few months. I just don't know what to do and I feel horrible. Every year I think ""next year will be better"" and I'm always proven wrong. Things are just getting worse and worse. I know im externalizing my frustration by being so angry at my sister (and the world in general) but I don't know how to stop. Im literally pulling my hair out from the stress. Everything just feels so bleak and hopeless.

Does anybody have any suggestions or advice? How do I cope with all of this? Posted to other subs too because I just need someone to talk to. I just feel so disconnected from the world, I've isolated myself and I was completely cognizant the whole time I was doing it but felt and feel powerless to stop it. I finally got in touch with a psychiatrist but he just prescribed me adhd meds almost immediately. I don't know how to talk to him about any of this other stuff going on. I feel like I'm losing my grip. Please talk to me.

I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and depression, and I am not coping with them anymore I really aren't, and I'm struggling with them, been diagnosed since I was 18 with both so they're not new things in my life, I have seen counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists and doctors about them since and I don't know why nothing is working, I'm on medication for them, I'm currently seeing a psychologist now.

I have attempted suicide multiple times, I have self harmed, with cutting, burning and scratching my hands and arms till they bleed, been kept in hospital overnight and the only way they would let me out was if I spoke to the crisis team and I lied so they would let me out.

I only have a couple of regular people in my life (mum and sister), and I have screwed up completely to the point my mum has washed her hands clean of me, I live with her, I don't know what to do anymore.

I'm having treatment for a lump which could be cancerous I don't know for sure till the doctors take it out and test it and all I could think of was this is it my way out, no more feeling tired all the time, no more waking up and hating myself and wondering how I'm going to screw up today.

I do stuff that I know is going to end badly but I still do them, I get distracted a lot, I can't stop fidgeting, I daydream a lot to the point I'm in my head damn near all the time, I get angry and defensive so easily and I react before thinking all the time, hell I act 90% of the time without thinking. All I do is screw up and say sorry and then do something worse later down the line, I honestly don't know what to do anymore, I think my mum has every right to clean her hands of me I do, and it generally doesn't bother me and that scares me, I don't know why I don't care or act like I don't care its like I'm scared to admit to myself that I'm messed up, I mean I cannot think of a good enough reason to not end it all, I'm just so tired I wish I could just crawl into a hole and pass away but knowing me I'd screw it up again, I have an appointment with my psychologist on the 25th of march, I just need help, before I lose the only person that has ever truly been there or help me come to terms with the fact I have already lost her.

1jflc9r,2025 has been rough,MentalHealthSupport,1742464660.0,0,2,"Tw for drug use, overdose, abuse, death, probably more

I'm just having rough year and I can't seem to catch a break.  It started with my mental health being garbage due to being harassed at work.  I was being harassed because of being disabled.  I reported it, but she made up lies about me instead and management decided it was hear say.  I ended up applying for medical leave because I was really not okay and the harassment was heavily affecting me and if I didn't take action I was scared of where things were headed.  But I was denied medical leave and I ended up missing work a bunch because I couldn't get myself to go.  I was fired about a month ago.  Right after I was fired, my mom almost died.  She spent awhile in the ICU where it came to light she's been hiding an addiction.  There's another post on my profile that goes more in depth on this if you want more information.  My bio dad is also an addict and relapsed this year.  During this, I tried to confide in my best friend of 14 years who instead unfriended me basically because I confided in her.  There is also a post on my profile that goes in depth on this situation too.  My mom is in rehab now.  I'm still not talking to her.  And I know she's gonna get home and try to act like nothing happened and like we all should move on.  I know I'm making the right choices for myself by staying firm on my boundaries and refusing that this just be sweeped under the rug and forgiven right away, but it's so hard and exhausting.  I'm so tired of having to advocate for myself.  I feel like I'm the only one being reasonable here.  Everyone thinks rehab is the end of it, but the rest of my family doesn't know what it's like to have an addict parent.  This shit stays around and it's something we need to watch for for the rest of our lives.  And I personally will likely never trust her again.  And I kind of blame her for losing my best friend.  I wouldn't have had to confide in her so much if my mom didn't give me so much to need to talk about, not just recently but my entire life.  I know that friendship wasn't real or beneficial but it still hurts.
Now the newest development, my mom's friend that brought her the drugs while she was in the ICU just overdosed.  They are in the ICU now and on life support.  I'm pissed that they brought my mom drugs and enabled her addiction, but I'm also incredibly sad and scared.  This friend means a lot to me.  Despite their struggles with addiction, I always looked up to them as a queer role model.  They helped me so much with queer issues my family didn't understand.  They inspire me to be a safe space for queer kids some day the way they were for me.  Things aren't looking good.  And the idea of them dying feels like a weight on my chest and I can't sleep.  I'm so scared we're gonna get the call that they died.  I keep having panic attacks.  I'm heart broken for their kid and their parents who already lost their other kid to overdose.  I don't know how to cope with everything.  My OCD is also using this to convince me I shouldn't take my meds because maybe I'll get addicted even though they aren't typically addictive.  In the last two months addiction has been the biggest thing on my mind.  It's something I've always feared for myself.  So much so that before any of this even happened, I made the decision that I wouldn't be drinking this year because I don't like how happy it makes me and how sad I feel after.  It's not like I drank often, at most once every 2 months.  But I know I am predisposed because of my parents and I'm not taking chances.  I also never smoked or did anything more than drink on occasion.  But I have nightmares about being an addict.  I looked into the family members of addicts support groups but I likely won't be able to attend one until Monday.  The only positive is that I am starting a new job and it seems like a great fit for me.  But I'm also worried that everything going on in my personal life is gonna affect my work and I'll get fired again.  Like what if I need to take off work within the first 90 days for a funeral?  What if I'm at work and I get that call?  Or I get the call that my mom decided to sign herself out of rehab?  Or maybe something else entirely?  I'm just so overwhelmed with everything and with the loss of my best friend I'm having trouble confiding in anyone else because I'm scared they'll say it's too much and leave me too.",i cant cope
1i421yh,first time posting,MentalHealthSupport,1737183939.0,6,8,"hi people... i'm kinda at a loss for words. i'm 31yo and can't remember the internet acronym for when someone is a long time reader and first time poster. all i can think of is yolo and LOL and both wanna make me cry and scream at the same time. i dunno why i'm trying to be funny, i'm here because im in quicksand. I feel like i'm drawing a big SOS with a stick on the beach only the self-pity and self hate has boldened the letters and started sucking me in, and i feel stuck. with no escape. 

  
its a classic silver spoon type upbringing, pacific northwest (i'm from Canada), great childhood etc but my entire existence feels like its been leading me up to this point. of crying for help. online. because my coping choices led me into debt (aka I'm also a self-absorbed idiot) and all i ever think about is what a failure ive become. how i let everybody down and what does that even matter anymore because its only my future at stake and that feels like a story that will never end good. 

i digress... i'm really scared and i have nothing. i pay rent under the table cuz i'm lucky to have friends and family who have the heart to care, and meanwhile i'm dying of guilt and shame and the negative feedback loop feels inescapable. can you tell i'm male yet? why do i bother to mention this? cuz i thought i was also progressive and cared and had a big heart etc and grew up wanting to do something and im realizing how predictable and shallow i've really been all along.

feels like i'm punishing myself and driving some kind of hell closer to reality. its not like i'm unmotivated to start a family one day, its that it feels completely unattainable and that I havent done and continue to do nothing to deserve a chance. if you read til here well... i do thank you. wish i could leave with something positive to say but i'm really, really down for the count. oh, i'm also unemployed and have no sense of direction or purpose. just waiting till i get kicked out or something i guess. 

and still... with love.",i cant cope

I have had only one ever good experience with a girl and she passed away over a year ago. The other ones have caused me stress over the years. I have been beat, verbally and physically abused, cheated on, falsely accused of rape wich was proven false soon after, used as a mental crutch, and when I was finally in love and felt complete the girl passed away. 2024 was the worst year of my life and I didn't even think it was possible to get that bad.

 There is times throughout the year where I genuinely believed to death is better than what I was suffering with. I no longer think that way and think suicide is never the answer in very selfish. But people keep telling me work on yourself and the right girl will come along I've worked on myself significantly and feel like a better person there's still a hole in the depths of my soul that I can't fill.

 I recently found out I have panic disorder that was likely developed after the year of suffering from mental strain depression and severe loneliness. I haven't dated or had a positive experience with a girl in over a year. I stay optimistic but the Hope does dwindle sometimes and hard to believe that I can find love even I still hold on to a little hope I do but I don't expect it to happen. 

I have only one friend left and my family that's it. I'm not as depressed as I used to be but there's still moments where I feel truly lonely and worried about my future and those who will be in it and worry that I won't be the father a husband and have a family that I desire and that I've worked so hard to find one day I need help.

1ijhze6,I feel empty inside,MentalHealthSupport,1738887771.0,0,1,"19M college student. I don't feel like dragging this post so I'll try to be succinct. For the past few weeks or so, I've been feeling as what I can describe as emptiness looming over me. 

Nothing bad of notice had happened, yet I've been feeling melancholic and numb. I don't look forward to the next day. My life isn't bad by any means, but for some unknown reason, it feels extremely uneventful and dull. I don't have many things to look forward to, and even for the few exceptions, I don't feel as excited and optimistic about them as I could have. It's as if my whole life is redundant and I'm just acting as a spectator in it. The obvious solution would be to find more hobbies that would bring about more purpose in my life, but I think that I know myself enough that they wouldn't fill up the unexplained hole that resides inside me. My mind would simply find a way to recontextualise it as repetitive and unfulfilling. The best way I can describe my state is that the joy I could once experience has become a foreign feeling to me, as if it doesn't exist anymore and that there is no way for me to bring it back in its truest form.

I might also be at a point where this feeling is acting retrospectively, so that I don't even remember my last moment of true happiness, or at least I don't understand why it even brought me any kind of joy. For some strange reason, I also feel like my friendships are relatively pathological in the sense that I don't feel like my friends even trurly know me and are just in it for the sake of having fun and killing time. Although to be fair to myself, I've been looking at friendships most people my age have the same way. I don't know if this morbid outlook is a false view caused by my state, or a very real problem that contributes to it.

I absolutely hate the mental state I'm in right now, and it might even contribute to some degree of derealization, as if I'm dissocisting from real emotions and feeling life through a layer of fogginess, both emotionally and perceptively. But it feels very subtle and gradual. It's not an obvious and aggressive feeling, but a whispery hunch that something is deeply wrong and I'm just slowly starting to realize it. And the worst part of it is that it feels very familiar, innate and that I don't even know what's causing it. This is not my attempt to be edgy, it's a geniune cry for help and any kind of serious advice would be very appreciated. ",feeling empty

1hirqnv,My mom makes me feel empty inside ,MentalHealthSupport,1734723272.0,0,1,"Hi! 21 male here. I just need to vent and maybe chat with someone about this. So! I bet you're wondering why I gathered you here...

My mom has a lot of issues. Both physical illnesses, as well as depression and alcoholism. Don't get me wrong, she tried her best to be my mom and never intentionally hurt me. The alcoholism started *fairly* recently (or at least got more severe), so it didn't affect me as much. But. She tried to end her life three times since I started college. Last time was last Sunday. I thankfully wasn't there to witness it as I study in a different city, but she tried to OD her meds, as she tried in the past. The first one is a whole different story and that one definitely traumatized me the most. 

Sorry, this seems chaotic but you needed that context. She often does stuff that no child should see a mother do. During the summer break, when I stayed at my parent's, my dad was travelling for work a lot so it was just me and her. I used to find hidden bottles of vodka everywhere in the house, she would lie to my face, forget basic stuff, refused to eat. Each day I was more and more tired and each day....I felt less bad fot her. I was getting angry. Snappy, irritated. There was stuff happening before that as well of course. I was basically forced to worry about her from a very young age and the roles of a parent and their child were reversed, in the psychological sense. 

I grew distant to all those issues and recently I did something...weird. I got a call from my dad that my mom had another attempt. I felt nothing. The next day, I was chatting with a friend and I was just ranting about why I don't really feel the Christmas spirit this year and said ""oh and on top of all that, my mom tried to kill herself AGAIN"" and moved on. I said it like I was saying that she did something small and not meaningless. But the look my friend gave me, made me realise that maybe I should have felt a bit more sad. 

This is all a chaotic pile of text, but I hope it wasn't that bad. I find talking about it a bit therapeutic, my DMs are wide open if someone wants to chat. I also like video games and study chemistry, just so you know anything else about me than that nasty stuff lol",feeling empty

Hi Reddit.

I'm posting this because a friend recommended it to me. I feel empty, angry, sad, and lonely. But I'm now I'm not alone. I just need to speak, write about what I'm feeling. I need to connect with people and talk to someone who know what I'm currently feeling.

First of all, I'm getting professional help. I see a psychologist and a psychiatrist. For now, I just have anxiety meds, not anti depressor, and I'll see with my doctor next month how October was to see if we start AD or not (I think I might need it).

It's a long story. And I want to list the trigger warnings first, because there's a lot : depression, SA, suicide, toxic relationship, domestic violence, manipulation, sexual harassment, moral harassment, toxic friendship, autism, mental health issues and content warning child and animal abuse.

I'm also not a native English speaker, I'm French, so sorry if I make some grammatical mistakes. I hope you'll be able to understand me. Writing in English, even though I'm not quite fluent, helps me take distance with what I'm writing.

So I'm 28, and next month, I'll turn 29. I knew my life has been hard, and that I'm struggling with so mental health issues, I've made a promise to myself (starting as a joke) that, my 10's and 20's were shitty, but my 30's will be good. So I hade until my last 29yo day to get my life together.

So, July the 27th of this year (2024), my last toxic relationship ended. It was my best friend from high school. And to summarize, because I have so much to tell about it, it will be so long, this person (let's call her B) managed to get me drop off my thesis, move next to her, take care of her kids, cleaned her house, live for her, slept (not sex, actuel sleep) with her because she got dump by her husband for 3 weeks, and lived with her so she can keep heur house. She used to get angry if it took me more than 8 minutes to get to her house when I had to ge there. She made me feel guilty for seeing my parents and other friends. She weaponized my homosexuality against me so, so get a creepy guy out of her back, she made me tell him I was in love with her (which I was not). BUT she finally decided to date the guy, and never told him the truth. So he began sexually harassing me, because lesbians turn him on. She knew I couldn't let her children cry and stay in their filth, so she let them cry, and scream, until I took care of them so they feel good and safe.  
When her husband dumped her, she was obviously sad, so she asked me to stay with her. Every time I wanted to go home and sleep in my place, with my cats, she cried, even if she was doing okay before. She made me feel guilty to let her alone. So I woke up very early to go home and stay with my cats, play with them, cuddle them. Sometimes, I leaved at 2am, while she was asleep, to spend time home. During this time, her husband was still in the house. I took care of the kids, because he started drinking, ans she was too sad to take care of them. And they felt all the stress so I put my life on hold for her and for them, because she needed me, and they needed me too. (they were 4 and 2). During this time, she dated the creep and they invited them to my apartment to have sex, so I couldn't sleep because of the noise. They started to touch each other in front of me, simulate sex in front of me, even though I said how it was hard for me.  
She used my traumas against me saying I should accept the harassment of her new boyfriend (the creep), because he speaks about me doing things to girls, ans watching them. But he often said he wanted to make me come, turn me heterosexual, and I just need ""the ONE true D"" to know I like it.

I know her since high school. She was one of my bully, but she took my side because the queen bee said ""if you speak to her, I'll never speak to you again"". And I became friend with her (I know...). After high school I met my first and only boyfriend (I'll get back to him after). Let's call him C. B never liked C. And during the 7years of relationship with him, it was just humiliation, violence, SA, mental abuse. So when I finally leaved him, I was a mess. I lived 300km from her, and she was there for me on internet (but we were friends IRL). Me being single was an opportunity for her. Now that I was single, I had no excuse to not give her time. During this time, my chronic illness was hitting hard. I walked with canes, I weighted 135kg, I was on AD, on anxiolytics, and struggling with the trauma of domestic abuse. And, I was working on my thesis, but it was hard. I had to give her all my times.  
I do novella role play since 2008. I showed her what it was in high school, and we were writing together, as I was writing with other people, and for myself. I had to write her every day, it had to be done before she ended work, and then the night was hers, because she wanted to write. If I was going out during the day, I had to take picture for her, tel her what I was doing, with who, and respond to her messages, to distract her because she was bored. She repeated that my thesis was pointless, like my degree, that I was wasted time. All of that made me drop off my degree. I felt alone in the city I was. I moved there for C. So I needed time out of the city, even though I liked it, to disconnect it from C. So, she made me move next to her home (5 minutes), and she got me a place at her job. Her creepy boyfriend worked there too.

Here's the big lines to the story. So we are know in July. She is getting divorced. Her ex husband took my appartement, and I moved with her so she could keep her house (I was supposed to pay her rent). I felt it was a bad idea. But I did it anyway, saying myself that if I didn't feel well with her, I had money to move out, and stop this friend ship, but I needed to see where this idea will go.  
She wasn't supposed to live with her creepy boyfriend. But he was there all the times. Once, the even got out of her room naked, because the youngest was crying in front of the door, and she asked me to put him in front the TV so he stops crying, because it made her boyfriend uncomfortable for sex. I said no. So she took care of her kid herself.  
Living with her, I decided I do my chores only, I was no longer her baby sitter too. I took care of my four cats, her dog, and her too cats though. But my cats had their litter in my room, and I paid for litter for all the cats, and dit litter for al the cats. And feed all the animals.  
Also, the was waiting for me to contract a 30k loan at the bank, that I DIDN'T DO.

Since B had her creepy boyfriend, she treated me more and more badly (but she was abusive and controlling all of the beginning). I was doing a therapy because my ex boyfriend wasn't the first abusive person in my life (at the time I didn't identify B as abusive), and I wanted to stop the cycle, work on myself, and heal from the trauma he inflicted me. During the process, I identified her as abusive. And repeated myself ""maybe she is the last toxic relationship you have, if she don't respect your new boundaries"". I decided to regain my life. Because I stopped doing novella role play with anyone but her, I also stopped writing on my book, and drawing. I'm a freelance illustrator since 2019. But she made me stop drawing...  
So I started doing role play again, and also seeing my friends again. I didn't care of her guilt trip anymore. And I decided to go for a trip to my old city, 300km away, for a surprise anniversary to a close friend that I didn't see since I moved out.  
So the 27 of July, I take the road, and I go on my week end. My cats are in my room, they have food, water, I go back home the next day. She don't have to take care of them, and I juste want to see my friends. This day, I receive threat messages from her creepy boyfriend saying I'm a b\*tch, I can speak to him anymore, I can't look at him, I don't exist. Why ? He learned that I shared my concerns about him.

B and me had a new friend she introduced me : D. I shared to her, that I was feeling so uncomfortable with him, that I hated the sexual harassment. Also, that he was manipulative, and abusive to B. Why ? Because he told me. And I always told her, and him, that he was a creep, abusive, and manipulative. He loved telling me all about their sex life, because the first time, B shared to me how it was. Since, he told me every morning how he was doing her (remember he thinks I'm in love with her, she never told him the truth). Every disgusting homophobic and sexual words he said to me, I responded that he had to stop, he was disgusted, and I thought he was creepy. When he told me their sex life, he described me SA. he ""got in the wrong hole"" of he ""did in by the back door while she was drunk"" or ""doing her stuff while she was asleep"". I discussed it with B, and the said she knew it wasn't mistake, and normal. I said to her I was there for her, but she couldn't forced me to like him, because he was dangerous.  
Anyway, they both new how I felt, but I made the mistake to speak to D. I shouldn't speak to her.  
B also sent me threat messages. I asked her if she knew what her boyfriend has told me, she said yes, and he was right, because he was angry. So I stopped responded. But she kept sending messages other and other. I panicked. Because they were crazy and dangerous, and my cats were at there.

My cats are my babies, my life. I love them so much. I need to spend time with them, take care of them. And I hate myself for the time she made me sleep at her home during the breakup, because I couldn't spend enough time with them.  
I was so scared they hurt them that I kinda turned crazy. I called my dad, who was at 400km from B (and she knew my family was in vacation), asking him if I could go home with my cats. I explained to him what happened, sent the messages. I was saying other and other that they will hurt my cats and I wanted my cats. To calm me, he called her. She tried to turn my parents against me. So my sister took the phone and said that I was going home the next day (Sunday), and that my parents will be there. We will be discussing the issue, I will be taking clothes, my cats, and that I will be getting back during the week to get all the rest of my stuff. But she really better not to hurt my cats, because if she does, we will go to the police. She said she won't hurt them.  
This kinda calm me. But I was really scared of the Sunday evening.  
The 28, at 9AM, my dad calls me saying they are living right know, because she is throwing all of my stuff in the streets. I turned crazy again. I had trouble breathing. I was crying, shaking, and I couldn't saying anything else than ""my cats."" because if she was throwing my stuffs in the street, where were my cats ? And I wasn't able to drive, my family were at 4h drive away. My dad had the chance to have a friend needy with his truck. He was visiting his daughter. So they took the truck and got my stuffs. Creepy boyfriend got physical against the daughter and threatened her. B's mother and creepy boyfriend were violent and throwing all things away. B's dad was sad. And she didn't said anything.

Please take note that this what has been told me, because I wasn't there.

My parents arrived hours after and my cats were dehydrated. I have 4. So two were in a cat box, one in a cat box, and on in a paper box (the one we use to move, the brown one). They had diarrhea on the road (1h of road to return to my parents home), and they were really really thirsty. Because it was 31¬∞C, and they were in the sun. But my parents took care of them.  
I got home the next day, the 29. A blocked her everywhere, so as her family, friends, our colleagues, her boyfriend, everyone. It took me 5h instead of 3 to go home because I was in shock, and tired. Back home, I discovered my stuffed... there was garbage in there. I threw 4 100l bags of garbage. And I tried to save what she hadn't broke.

Now, I'm still at my parents home, and my babies are doing really good. They are happy, and with me. But I'm a mess. All I wrote isn't all this relationship. She threw tantrum because I had a girlfriend, she tried to still on of my book, she juste shattered every piece of me, everything I tried to built myself. If something wasn't her, it didn't count. She ruined a client/tatoo artiste relationship because it was my tattoo artist, the was always talking bad of me. I lost 40 kg in one year, I don't use cane anymore, juste because, living with myself, I cooked healthy meals, and I was doing sport. And not having someone hitting me all the time helped not feeling hurt all the time. But she had lost 60 kg by sleeve, so she hated when people congratulated me. She hatted when I got complimented about my look, my art, everything. And I learned she told everyone at work I was stupid because I was autistic. That she made me move there because I had no life where I was (I had a life, and friends).

Anyway... I just feel garbage. Because she wasn't the only one. My exboyfriend SA me so many times... he used to beat me, but not when he was angry, si I didn't understand it wasn't normal. He beat me for fun, for joke. Out of nowhere I could got a fist, or a slap in thr face or body. He forced me to sleep in his fluid because I wasn't aloud to change the sheets after he finished. I had to chose all other me, or in the sheet... he used to pee on my in the shower, and smash my head in his fluids... he broke me. he dehumanized me. And he wasn't the worst. I leaved him because I was often crying seeing girls couple. Because I'll never have this in my life. I spoke to it with my therapist, saying it will pass, it was a phase. He told me it wasn't a phase, that I was homosexual, and I can take the time I need to accept it. But it will never pass. Three days later, I broke up with my ex, because I was a lesbian. And I figured all the violence I was living in AFTER the break up.

He wasn't the first one. B wasn't the first one. The first toxic relationship I had. A. Was a 13yo girl, I was 12. I have a lot of amnesia about her. But she SA me multiple time saying it was to ""learn for the boys later"". If you know kanazuki no miko, she was obsessed with it. I never saw the anime. But the SA scene, I know it by heart, because she did it to me, I know the lines, I know everything. She made me do stuff, and she wanted us tou end each others lives. I didn't want to. So she wanted us to run away. I had impulse phobia. My autism wasn't diagnose, so I thought my meltdowns were insanity, that I was violent, and I will hurt my little sister. I thought I was a monster. I talked to A bout it. She said I was a monster. That I hurt people, I have the devil in me. And if I don't kill it, I'll be like a disease, I'll intoxicate people until I ruin their lives.  
I was so broken that the could made me do anything. One morning, I just said okay to run away. I have no memory for the run away. Juste me running in the fields (my parents live in the country) laughing. Then a black out. And my memories get back hours later, around 6PM. I'm sitting on a tree trunk. I turn my phone on. I see 42 voice mails. The last one if from my dad. So I listen to it. He is crying. He asked me to go back home, that he loves me, I'm his little kitty (he calls me that), they all need me home. A is laughing. And I don't know why, but I'm looking at here, horrifying by this person, and I call my dad.  
I still hear him screaming. He cries and asks me where I am. So I look around. I recognize a climbing spot I go in summer. But I'm on the top on the cliff. I climbed the cliff road and I have no memories. At the time I don't understand. But the cliff is 50m tall.  
I tell him I'm at the city cliff. And they he screams ""please little kitty don't jump. Don't jump. Please don't die. I love you.""

But I don't understand. I'm strongly calm. I say him that I won't jump, I'm sitting on a trunk. He beg me to wait for him. A don't speak to me anymore. Minutes after, my dad arrives with the police, and two police cars. One for each other. Back home, there's my mom crying, trying to calm my little sister, and A's mom, saying that I'm crazy and toxic. That I'm the one who told her daughter to do it.  
It wasn't the final point of A. My parents went to therapy with me to understand what to do. The therapist told them the emprise was so strong, they couldn't force me not to see her, I risked to run away again, or to heart myself. So they had to wait I stopped this friendship myself. It happened in the summer. Because A cut her wrist in front of my little sister with a knife, to punish me, because I didn't want to go to the pool with her. I took my sister with me to protect her, told A she was a crazy, and call my mom. I never spoke to A again. I went to an high school in a different city (it happened the year before high school) and I just ghosted her.

Since B throwed my stuffs on the street, I live with my parents. I'm continuing therapy. And I finally talked about A. Because I couldn't before. B was the only one who I spoke to about A. She forced me to tell all about it to her creepy boyfriend, to justify me not accepting the harassment (I had a ptsd attack during two days after). But I finally spoke about her to my therapist... And always thought that day on the cliff, if y hadn't turn on my phone, we would have jumped together. My therapist told me we wouldn't. She told me I would have. But A would just watched me. And I felt it was true. And it broke me even more.  
This girl could have kill me. She could have watch me jump off a 50meter cliff to feel less in distress, and I would have die without even know it.

I'm in violence since I'm 12. I understand why I had let B and C do me all this stuff. I understand why I accepted this, why I did things that destroyed my life, sometimes without them asking me to. A put all this in me.  
I was so scared to be the monster she told me I was that, to avoid being a bad person, avoid harming people I loved, I destroyed myself for other. I pushed my boundaries, I ignored reflags, I accepted unbelievable things. And I had to go to therapy to realize it wasn't normal at all. But why A ? Why her ? Why me ? And why all this ?

My therapist told me that now that I understand this, now that I don't ignore reflags anymore, now that I know my limits, and that I put my boundaries, I won't accepting this shit anymore. They are not afraid for me about this, they are sure I won't getting back to this shit. But when I think of me, when I look back all these years, I hate myself. I hate that accepted this, I hated that I excused them, I protected them.

What is my life know ? I used to write. I used to dream about publishing books. I was just about to succeed. I had clients, I had a shop, and a name as an illustrator. In a little circle, but it was growing, and I let B destroy this. I let her took my storied to be part of it. I let her make me doubt about my writing and I dumped my thesis... I let her staying away from my art. Writing, and drawing, that was mine. That was all I had. My thesis was my pride.

Since July, I try to get back that was mine. I registered to finish my thesis. I got all of my sketchbook back, and I reread all what I had written. I worked on what she tried to still me to getting my ideas back, and my story back. I took a subscription at sport club because I like it. But it's so hard.  
I'm finghting everyday. I have no energy, I can't focus. I love my thesis but working on it is just fucking hard. I love sport but going to the gym is violent for me. Because it's something I like, something I do for me. And all these years I was punished every time I did something for me. So when I go, I dissociate... I don't feel anything. I'm a robot.  
I can't spend time in silence. I always have to listen to podcast, or YouTube, or anything. Music is hard because my thought flow and overwhelmed me. I try to write. I made a list of all I have to work to start rewriting and reposting my book but every time I do a task, I get more and more scared. I loved sharing my book. I used to post on wattpad. I had my little community. But know I'm scared. I want to share but it froze me. I try to draw. I draw a little every time. I know I can draw. I know I'm good at it. I love to share it, but it's a fight to focus and not juste to throw everything away because it's pointless.

Everything gets more and more pointless. And I fight to keep the light in me. I don't want to not care anymore. I don't want to give up. I want to feel the joy to go to gym. I want to regain my pride self-confidence.  
I used to love reading, so I bought myself books. But I can't read. I can't because it's letting go. I can't letting words take me, I can't let them make me feel feelings I don't control. I can role-play. I got that back. Because I'm part of it. So I'm safe, I control. But why is it so damn hard to write ? I control when I'm writing, no ?  
I don't understand. I know I have to connect with myself but every time I try, I juste cry for ours, or I lie down with my cats purring and I look at the emptiness of my life. I'm almost 29, I didn't achieve anything. I'm just breathing.  
What I used to have, despite all this mess, B broke it. I'l fighting to rebuilt it.

I lived so many traumas, why this one is so hard ? is it because I know have to deal with the accumulation of all this years ? I don't think I'm ready for it but I have no choice.  
I'm scared of feeling empty. I'm scared of not getting back what I had. I'm scared of failing again in my dreams.  
I'm angry because it's part of my fault it all those things happened to me. I allowed it. I hate my past self for that. And I'm scared of my know self. I don't know who I am.  
I can't have physical relationship. I kinda dating a girl I really like, but I'm scared of hurting her with all the mess I carry. I'm scared of hurting her if I'm not ready for physical stuffs. I'm also scared my therapist are wrong and I go back in hell again.  
I feel lonely. I kneed to connect with people but it's hard. My parents try their best to help me, but every time they question something, or ask what I am doing, or say that my make up is good, or I did a good video, I feel in danger, attacked, undercontrol, and I close myself. I hate myself for that, because it's so hard to be around me right know, I know it. But I can't control it.

I'm sad when I see what was my life. I'm sad when I realize I don't remember me before trauma. What I could have look like without them ? What I could be without all these wounds. And will it heal some day ? And when ? My life is a pile of broken things, rotten things. I juste had some precious dust in it, like my family, my cats, and those things that are mine, like writing, reading, drawing, role-playing, my hope for my thesis It's all I have know. It's so little. I can't lost it. I can't fail. But it's juste hard. And I don't want to end things, I don't want to stop feeling, I don't want to be empty.

Just, I know someone felt the same way that I do. I just need to her it gets better. I need to know how, and how long it took. I don't want to feel the need to die again. I don't want to go back in the dark place. I know it's just a hard time, but why is it so hard, I survived to so much worse than stuffs thrown in the street ?

I'm sorry is it's hard to understand to what I'm writing. I'm a bit confused.  
I juste want to get lost again, and I need to connect with people who understand. I tried to connect with writers, and illustrators.

I used to have an old user name (it was ophelia\_yeti) but I don't use it anymore. That why my account is so young. That old username was the nickname B gave me. She told that she created me because of it. I changed to have something that's mine. But no-one know me with this new name. I wasn't somebody but I used to have an identity, I have to rebuilt everything know. All I had, all I am.  
It even feels like I have tu just built me. I don't know if I have ever been before.

Again, I'm not in danger, and I have tho therapist. I'm not alone because I don't have apartment or furniture lol. But mostly because I know I can't live alone at the moment, I'm to fragile. It's not an alert, I won't hurt myself. I know there is hope, and it's will get better. But it's so hard I need so speak, and to get this of my chest. I need to not feel alone in the storm. It's just so hard. It's not a day and day fight, it's hour per hour. Every hour is a challenge, because I can feel empty and just look in the void, of cry, of fell relief, or angry. I never felt like this before. It's hard to understand and to getting through it.

I also don't know how to end this post... juste thank you if you read all of this. It's so big I doubt anyone will have the patience. If you didn't, don't worry. But if you did, juste thank you. And sorry for all this over sharing. I just hope you are doing better than me.

And please. Please, please please, listen to you, don't push your boundaries, don't ignore reflags, don't be me. Live YOUR life, be happy, and achieve your dreams ‚ù§Ô∏è

does anyone with bpd can tell me the best advice on what to do after breaking a close friendship because of self-sabotaging? I recently hurt a close friend to me who meant a lot to me. she was sweet, funny, very kind and patient and understanding. and i ruined it all because i had gotten triggered over something small about her giving more affection to someone else. this isn‚Äôt the first time this kind of thing happened, where i became cold and distant and angry, and i said i would‚Äôve gotten better and for a while i thought i did. but just that one small act made me go from 0 to 100 and after the fact, she came to me and said we should go our separate ways for the time being. until both me and her had gotten to a better place mentally where the possibility of being friends again can come up. i miss her so unbelievably much, and things would‚Äôve been find if i had just communicated with her. but i didn‚Äôt and now she won‚Äôt be keeping contact with me any longer. 

The way that i had behaved has caused her own mental health to decline, and she couldn‚Äôt go through that anymore. i do not blame her at all, i just wish we didn‚Äôt have to be apart.. i miss her so much. Does anyone have advice on how to be better? so that i can be able to be normal and happy and go back to her?

All my life I've tried to be the ""good kid"" and I succeed for the most part.
 I'm nice and thoughtful, loud and sometimes funny
But for all the good I try I get pain back tenfold.
I wonder what it's like to be loved. To know a person volunteeringly loves you
Every year when valentine's crawls around I face people in love, and it never ceases to be painfull
This year I had feelings I never thought I could have for a girl
And she doesn't like me that way.
Which is fine, it's her choice.
But it still hurts. And this makes the first genuine love I've felt for a girl
What a great way to enter the party: tripping flat on your face one step in 
The worst part is I can't say this. I can't tell people that I burn my skin to distract from sadness, or that I punched my knuckles bloody on the wall
I'm not good company like this
And no one knows me like this, and no one cares to know
My parents would yell and send me back to the hospital And my friends would never speak again
How does it feel, I wonder, to be cared for?
How does it feel for people to listen to the truth?
 How does it feel for someone to sincerely ask how you are?
How does it feel to hold another person?
How it feels to hold hands while you walk, or argue about dishes, or talk about nothing In particular
 ""everyday I fall. Some days harder than others, but I can always see it. See the golden path, and the light it leads to‚Äù
Poetic isn't it?
I don't think a golden path was laid for me.
 I don't think there's a light I'm walking towards
 I don't think I have a purpose 
I'm an NPC in my own life
But I'm on the good side right? Upper middle class, a warm house with food and water, parents and brothers But I still don't see it
Sometimes it feels like stumbling in the dark fumbling for a light switch. You have no idea where you are, but you have hope the light will come on soon
But I think I've waited long enough 
Maybe I die tonight. 
Maybe I wuss out
 Maybe I hear a last minute argument for my life
Maybe I'll wake up to a different life
One without a mask
Once, about two years ago
A relative brought bed bugs to my room.
No one believed me at first. No one listened to me talking about bugs that drop from the ceiling onto my bed. No one bothered to check the massive bed bug nest on my ceiling.
I was being dramatic, they said. 
That I should clean my room more and the bugs will go away.
Three months I had those bed bugs Three long tortuous months
 Do you know what it's like? To be told by the people you trust most that your acting crazy? And have direct proof of the opposite?
 I took a picture of one of the bugs at one point
My dad said it was an asian lady beetle
Because lady beetles are flat and brown.
I had a breakdown at one point
I just couldn't take it anymore. My mother was holding me and my dad, while I was still crying, ""you know? I think they are bedbugs."" 
He laughed like it was the funniest thing he had ever said.
I had two breakdowns that day.
They gave me a wet rag and bed bug killing spray.
I did all the work.
But they persisted. They just wouldn't leave me alone
I had my third breakdown less than a week later after finding four different bed bug nests hidden in my picture frames on the wall.
I don't have those pictures anymore.
 My dad came in after ten minutes of my sobbing. 
He saw his son lying in the fetal position sobbing and hyperventilating and just yelled at me
I don't tell them how I feel anymore
Where was i? 
So this girl.
She wasn't the best looking, but she was and still is, the most endearing person I've ever met
 I love her laugh and her voice.
When she isn't paying attention to me I just stare into her eyes
They're small and worried. Her iris' are dark enough to match her pupils. Like two little black dots in her eyes
It's adorable 
I went to a fandom club because she was ecstatic to find it. It was adorable seeing her so worked up.
She used to come to my game meetings, despite knowing nothing about the game.
She would perch on a table and watch the people play
Kicking her feet while she did. 
I went to the dance for her.
She didn't know I only went because she was going.
We got pictures together. The photographer made us put our arms around each other in a way so my hand rested on the small of her back.
She was so warm 
My heart did this flop thing.
I was worried I was going to die.
She smelled nice.
Then it was over. And she pulled away
But she put her arms around me first, so I wasn't wrong to look into that.
Later that night she said she was cold. I offered her my jacket, she said no. 
Thirty minutes later she said it again and turned down the jacket.
 She caved in eventually. 
Now I have a picture of her in my suit jacket.
Maybe I should get rid of it
I wish I could be Close to her again
But that's weird. And thinking like that is creepy.
I missed her when she left the dance. But my brother roped me into something else before I could dwell on it
She hated dancing, I do too. 
She's polyandrous. 
Two partners I don't fit into that equation.
 I was willing to try polyandry, but she doesn't like me enough to entertain the idea
But I don't care. 
I don't care.
I don't care.
I don't care.
I don't care. 
I wonder if I say it enough will it come true?
I wonder who you guys are? 
I wonder what your stories are?
But that's foolish. I don't know you guys. You guys don't know me.
You actually know me surprisingly well now.
 I wonder if there is a point. 
A cosmic reason for my specific life?
I wish I could feel normal. 
I wish I could feel like the main character.
I wish I could delete the feelings i Had for this woman.
These previously undiscovered feelings.
I wish I didn't have to talk to a random person.
 I wish it was better. 
That's the big one. 
Better.

This started in 2021. I was a sophomore in high school. I was over weight and most girls never gave me a second look. so When a friend I had confessed feelings for me I was ecstatic. But a week into the relationship It took a odd turn. She brought me into the library before school and sat me down.    she said she wanted to do something but didn't know how to do it. then out of no where she just kissed me. Although I did not protest against it Mabey i I should have. It was only 3 weeks into the relationship she would convince me to have sex. then that would turn into non stop, She made it so hard to say no because I thought this is what love was. But not soon after she would turn verbally and sometimes physically abusive, even slapped me Infront of my mom at my own house. After months I broke up with her due to the abuse. 

  
Then 6 months later I would begin to date her friend. only for her to use me as a crutch and did not love me. That did not last long. But then I Later get in a relationship that lasted 3 weeks. I was siting with her and her sister at school. I told her I am so glad to feel happy with someone and confessed the hurt I have carried for so long from bad women. she broke up with me instantly after I said that. Only to find out she was talking trash and even was cheating on me the whole time. l

Later  the friend I had for over 3 years, she was perfect for me. She was the gift God chose to give me after all the hurt I felt over the years. We told each other we felt strong for each other. And were going to start seeing each other. Only at that point did my life feel the way I dreamed. I found the women I could see my life being with and the rare thing is she felt the same. (1 Week Later) She would be at a holiday party with close family before having a bad headach then she had colappsed on the floor. she was rushed to the hopsitle after suffering an anerism. She passed peacefully With freinds and family with her. But no one had said anything to me and I wasnt able to be there for her finale moments. I would only find her name on the State obituary. That was over 1 year and 2 months ago. 

So in the year of 2024 I suffered from severe Loneliness and depression. It was so bad I did not see my self still being here. But by somehow I survived the year agenst all odds of my own self.  I did not have the want in me to still be living. but I pulled through. I am now in therapy go to church and work out plenty. But as of the last month I have had panic attacks regularly. My therapist now believes since last year was so horrific on my brain and my mental health I have developed a panic disorder from lack  of female contact and extended severe loneliness and severe depression for so long.

  
Although I am better now, there are still moments everyday where I struggle and wonder If If my feelings are even valid anymore. I need some advice. And am I even right to feel the way I do. my family says I should not feel the way I do and need to ""Man up""",broken

It was everything she knew things I had only confided in my very best friend about. I wasn‚Äôt sexually active or on drugs. I had not even kissed a guy yet. This went on all the way up until I was a senior in high school. I was home one day ironing my Dads shirts and heard a noise coming from his closet. Thinking it was his pager he left I opened the door and started looking because he worked for the government and I knew that someone was trying to probably reach him. That when I found it. My heart dropped and there was a tape recorder. I removed the tape and took it to my room and you can probably guess. She had been recording all my conversations throughout the years. Listening to it on her way to work and then coming home and telling me that ‚Äúeveryone knows what I have been doing and they don‚Äôt want their kids around me‚Äù. This had always baffled me as I kept getting elected to every position that I would run for at school and continuously got homecoming and almost got homecoming queen. It just never made sense but it made sense then. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Our relationship was terrible (with my Mom) because she was so critical of me. I didn‚Äôt approach her because I didn‚Äôt know what to say. That‚Äôs when I decided to pretend to be selling drugs and making up lies to see what she would do. Finally the day came I went to her. She blamed it on me. I felt so betrayed. That‚Äôs when I left for college and didn‚Äôt want to ever come back. While at college my Dad was diagnosed with cancer. I was in a steady relationship with a wonderful man who built us a home that was more than I could ever dream of. I kept in touch but kept my distance from her. I didn‚Äôt want to go to college but she really gave me no choice and I wanted out of that. After we built and moved into our home I chose to look into cosmetology school. I told my mom who became angry and said that she would not support my decision and I would never amount to anything wo a degree. My boyfriend tried to talk to her and she was not having it. When she came to our home she never actually acted happy for me. It was probably three times the size of the house I grew up in. I didn‚Äôt know if she was jealous or what but that‚Äôs when the wheels came off. Stupidly I chose to break off my relationship by self sabotage because I have always wanted to please her. Soon after my Dad passed away from cancer. Their marriage was less than idea growing up and my Dad was never good enough but she was by his side until he passed. She called my ex to have him come to my apartment to tell me. At that time I was in a relationship that was not healthy. I was just about to graduate with a degree just to get out. I had a full time job and I jumped back into a relationship. I was happy. He had great parents who were divorced but I loved each side as they were totally opposite. We had dated for about a year and I found out I was pregnant. It wasn‚Äôt ideal but I looked at it as I had a degree under me and was in a relationship with supportive soon to be in laws. That‚Äôs when I called and told her the news. Just as I imagined she completely lost it. She did not care that I was happy. Immediately went to ‚Äúyou have a choice to have an abortion and not to let them being Catholic control that‚Äù She came and met his family before I found out I was pregnant. Had absolutely nothing nice to say about his family and made fun of them to my face. At this point I was working my sane full time job I had in college and the only thing she was paying was my rent. I was so upset by the way she acted that I was done. She called my boyfriend‚Äôs father (the other side) demanding they meet with her and her brother (my uncle) at their home about my pregnancy. I was totally humiliated because she was treating me like I was a 14 year old child. After I told her I was keeping the baby she told me that she was no longer helping me with my rent (only thing she provided). She called the complex I lived at and canceled the auto draft on my apartment. I was at work when I found out so I called his Mom. She immediately left her job, went and packed all my things and moved me out to their land where their son (my bf) was building a house. At this point I let her stay but kept my distance. She was never happy for me. It was like she couldn‚Äôt be. I had finally had a supportive family in his and his step father told me he wanted to make sure I had the best crib for our son. I mentioned it to my mother who then mocked his step father. We had a healthy baby boy. I let her be there but not in the room. She threw a fit. I didn‚Äôt care. Fast forward our relationship didn‚Äôt work out due to my self doubt. I struggled and still do with self esteem and self worth problems. This is only a fraction of what I dealt with regarding her growing up. Am I wrong for feeling this way? Is this abuse? I see things I do that remind me of her and it literally makes me physically ill. I look like her and I hate the way I look. I tried to maintain a relationship with her but it‚Äôs impossible. She got angry with me after getting plastic surgery ‚Äúwithout telling her‚Äù. I was married with two kids!!! What is wrong with her or is it me?",broken
1hajyx6,I Don‚Äôt Think I‚Äôm Okay And Need Help. My Motivation Is Gone And I‚Äôm Broken.,MentalHealthSupport,1733777298.0,1,1,"I‚Äôm an 18 year old guy and I used to be motivated to do anything. I just did things like studying like 2-3 weeks before a test or doing my homework really early. Then when I was 17 I got into a really bad accident I wasn‚Äôt hurt miraculously but the car rolled multiple times and was totaled. Idk what I was doing I was frustrated from college and work and not having any time to myself and started taking these backroads nobody was on and did stupid stuff like drifting and all that. I really should just be dead right now. And after that I went and finished all my school work and everything for the semester and had to use my sisters car. After that though I got a 2008 WRX it was really nice and I didn‚Äôt do any of the stupid stuff I did before I just really enjoyed driving it. My mental health was great because of it too. It just made going anywhere so much easier and when I‚Äôd get to where I was I‚Äôd be so happy because of it. Though one day though my friend let me use his calculator for a test since I forgot mine. So after I did my test I drove over to his place which I hadn‚Äôt done to often like maybe once or twice. I came up to this intersection and there were three cars that came to a stop and I saw four stop signs. One car went to my right and the one across me got there before I did so I went. Then bam a car t-boned the back of my car sending me flying into a ditch. I was like oh well at least it wasn‚Äôt my fault turned off the car. Got out and looked at the intersection. This time I only saw two stop signs. My heart sunk to my stomach. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. Last accident the insurance didn‚Äôt pay because we didn‚Äôt have the right plan. And I basically spent all my money on this car. I went and asked the other guy if he was okay he said yeah. So then I went back to my car and just stood there in front of it and started hyperventilating. I‚Äôve never had a panic attack before but I was thinking this is what it felt like when you were about to have one. Skip forward I paid the guy to fix the front of his car. It wasn‚Äôt that bad tbh. At least there wasn‚Äôt a claim. But I tried to get a claim on my car and it got rejected. So I had no money. No car and so I had to use my sisters car at this point. So I did that and I still am. So all that money I used to buy this car after working for the past 2-3 years was gone. I literally had absolutely nothing was financially back to where I was at 15. Skip forward to the beginning of fall semester at college first week of the semester. My parents start fighting more than they usually do and might actually get a divorce. Well my mom is anyways she‚Äôs been looking for a reason to divorce my dad forever so it is understandable. Even though he never does anything wrong for the most part at least compared to her. Then my grandma dies the next week. And at this point I‚Äôm not paying attention to my classes anymore I‚Äôm just done. Now about a week or two ago my mom says my dad is having an inappropriate relationship with my two sisters. Makes them feel like shit. Just because she wants to try and make my dad out as a monster when she is the real monster. At this point mentally I can‚Äôt even get up for work anymore I failed all my college classes. I have to schedule more for next semester but I just don‚Äôt feel like it. I have to go get my sisters exhaust welded today but I just don‚Äôt feel like it and have just been at home. There is this lead lady at work who is bullying me and I just don‚Äôt feel like going there anymore even though I‚Äôve worked there for 3 years it‚Äôs like after my car that was the last place I had to go to get away from my problems and now there is a problem in every place I am be it home, college, work, or in the car. There are no more safe places left for me. I feel alone and none of my friends hang out with me really they are all just busy I guess. But they are the only friends I‚Äôve ever had. They are all I have. Yet there is no one for me to be with and nowhere for me to go and get away. I‚Äôm not suicidal or anything and would never kill myself but if there was some kind of level right below that I think I‚Äôm there.",broken
1el2nxu,i‚Äôm at my wit‚Äôs end with my mind.,MentalHealthSupport,1722900696.0,0,3,"hi. i May end up deleting this soon after i post it but i need this now, for myself. i am 19 years old, and i have struggled on and off for a long enough time with mental health. unfortunately this is something i‚Äôve had to deal with alone- my parents would not ‚Äòaccept‚Äô my problems as in their minds I have nothing to be feeling like this about. and i have no friends to talk about it with. when i say that, i quite literally mean it- not one person i used to consider a friend has felt the same way back. i was always the one on the outside, be there a separate group chat, meet-ups without my knowledge, or just straight up ignorance of my existence. people have cared about me, i know that, but just not enough. or they‚Äôve had other friends that have been closer.

i self harmed at a young age. not badly in the sense of deep scarring injuries- you wouldn‚Äôt be able to even see the marks now to be honest. but i craved the feeling i got from doing it and for a while i felt like i was addicted to it. i relapsed on two separate occasions last year but have been clean for a while and yet, very sadly, i have been deeply craving it again. 

i don‚Äôt know how to make friends. i know what i can do and where to go to meet people, but i genuinely have no idea how on earth to convince them to stick around long enough to get to know me and want me in their life. i have been disappointed time and time again and at this point i don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs worth my effort. 

i feel terrible for my boyfriend too. he has to listen to me and help me when i get down and he tries his best. i am so thankful for him and lucky to have him. but he has what i so desperately need and want; friends. and naturally he wants to spend time with them. but I get so so frustrated and almost jealous when he wants to do things with them without me; partly because a good lot of them are girls and i worry that he‚Äôll end up finding one of them more interesting and fun than he finds me, but also because i don‚Äôt get that privilege too. i cant just tell him i want to go out for drinks with my friends cause‚Ä¶i don‚Äôt have any lol. it‚Äôs easy for him to say he thinks i‚Äôm great and i‚Äôll be fine getting friends because he actually has them already. he doesn‚Äôt quite know what it‚Äôs like or has been like for me as he‚Äôs mostly had some sort of positive influence in his life outside of his family. it tears me up inside every time because i trust him fully and i really want him to go out and have fun and be able to trust that i‚Äôm okay but he then feels guilty and worries about me and always ends up asking me to come which almost makes me feel worse because I don‚Äôt want him thinking he can‚Äôt be alone with his friends.

and then everything gets worse because i start convincing myself I don‚Äôt like him?? he‚Äôs amazing. he‚Äôs beautiful. he‚Äôs the kindest soul on this planet and so soft and gentle and he‚Äôs exactly what i need in a partner. i feel terrible because i then convince myself i‚Äôm not attracted to him because i used to say i had a different type to what he looks like- which is not true at all because i can tell y‚Äôall now this man is very much conventionally attractive and i am in love with every beautiful feature of his face and body and personality too (he has stunning eyes lol). i get worried that i‚Äôll end up annoying him too much and I keep thinking it‚Äôs not fair on him and it would be so much easier for him if he was with someone that wasn‚Äôt like me. but he says that he doesn‚Äôt like when i say that because he knows he doesn‚Äôt want anyone else and he loves being with me. he really does his job reassuring me so this is not at all anything to do with him, more so how my mental health impacts my thought processes.

i always feel like i‚Äôm faking it too. i stop crying and go oh that was unnecessary. i look at the good things in my life and think why on earth would i actually feel like this when i have these things around me. by all means my life is ‚Äògood‚Äô. family, job, uni, boyfriend. so I feel guilty for struggling because it‚Äôs not the fault of any individuals in my life.

i don‚Äôt know what illness i could have, if any. i don‚Äôt necessarily have manic episodes, i don‚Äôt have visual hallucinations (though some auditory), i haven‚Äôt attempted, I don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôve ever had a real panic or anxiety attack. i do have intrusive thoughts, some quite graphic ones at times. i also have extremely intense mood swings at times. and i do panic that one day, i will break and lose control of my body and won‚Äôt be able to stop myself from doing something stupid (to myself). i cant let that happen because i don‚Äôt want to do something i‚Äôll regret. 

i live with my parents so I can‚Äôt seek professional help without them knowing or at least being suspicious of it. i want to though. then maybe when i‚Äôm better i could talk. 

i also tend to ‚Äòconvince‚Äô myself of a lot of things. my brain tells me stuff i know isn‚Äôt true so i don‚Äôt know why i think it. i have even recently tried to convince myself i might be a lesbian (rooted in some truth- i don‚Äôt properly label my sexuality) because of good luck babe HAHA but i am most definitely physically attracted to my boyfriend and feel very happy in the relationship itself. 

a small TL;DR: i‚Äôm a 19 year old girl with crippling mental health problems and i‚Äôm unsure how to move forward. 

thanks to whoever sees this :) p",at my wits end
1183fs9,At my wits end,MentalHealthSupport,1676986127.0,0,1,"Just  found this group and thought I would see if anyone here had similar  experiences, suggestions, views, thoughts, or other wisdom.

Life  at the moment is pretty pants. I own my own property which has doubled  nearly in value since I bought it in 2014, but its in an area which is  no longer relevant to me, has come to represent everything I hate about  life & which is mentally & emotionally draining due to the fact  that the area in itself is a source of anxiety & stress for me.   I've planned to leave since 2018 but kept putting it off, despite having  an area I'd like to move to in mind, and actively having looked at  houses there. I wont remortgage here because I want to get out - so the  mortgage has shot up by ¬£500 in the last few months.

I  can't afford to buy there now but could JUST about afford to rent.  Being in the new area would remove the stress/anxiety caused by where I  own at the moment, and stop me traveling across the country to feel  better for the day every other week, saving me a fortune in fuel.

Back  in 2018 I was earning 6 figures a year as a contractor, a business  which seems to have gone to hell, and which I cannot seem to get back  into. Between times I have been freelancing doing technical work but the  work has now all but dried up, I also had a significant cushion (¬£30k)  of savings to rely on when things were slow, plus I was doing some  teaching on the side, but I havent been able to do that since last  summer due to an injury.

I put the  house on the market at the back end of last year but it has not had one  viewing to date, even after dropping the price by 10 grand. This week I  got in touch with the house buying companies who make you a below  market value offer on the property and was offered ¬£40,000 less than it  is currently on the market for. At this point I""m seriously considering  this option!

I can't afford to buy  there, but renting is an option. My wider plan is to rent for 2-3  years, wait for property prices to sort themselves out (I think they'll  drop, massively) & then look at buying again. Using that 2-3 years  to get my head on an even keel by being in a place I love, surrounded by  scenery, sights, sounds and smells which speak to me & hopefully  then I'll feel better, more productive, and more positive about finding  and generating work - I could go back out teaching again too because  there is a lot more of that kind of work there.

My problem:-

I  keep feeling like selling up & renting is a bad move & like I'm  doing the wrong thing. Despite the fact that nothing makes me happier  than being in the area I want to move to. I feel like I""ll be putting  the dog & I into an uncertain position for the rest of our lives. He  is 10 & I dont want to lose him in however many years, only for  that not to be a house I keep. He is my absolute world.

BUT  - If I stay here I will burn a fortune in fuel for days going back  where I want to be, I'll bawl my eyes out constantly because I""m here  putting up with noisy nightmare neighbours, and I'll run out of money in  the next 4 months. I'll get trapped. I'll never live where I want to  & the world will fall in on me.

If  I sell up for the ¬£40k less figure, I get ¬£115000, call it ¬£100k after I  move & pay a few things off, I can rent for a few years on that  & still retain enough for a deposit to buy somewhere, even if I have  to live on it for a while, right?

It  seems obvious what to do for the best when I see it written here, but I  keep having the jitters & whilst I know the only person who can  make the decision, ultimately, is me, my anxiety & everything else  is clouding my judgment . I'm medicated with Fluoxetine to cope with  life in general which has been, to say the least, traumatic. I have  never been happy in this area.

Anyones  views very welcome, I know from reading & plucking up the courage  to commit all this to writing, that you all have been through a lot  & some like minded advice would be very much appreciated.

Thank you x",at my wits end
1jljevy,My psychiatrist is threading to ‚Äúexpose‚Äù me to my parents,MentalHealthSupport,1743124730.0,4,4,"Hey guys i‚Äôm in a bit of a situation and I want to know how to navigate this. Background info i‚Äôm 20f and currently i‚Äôve been withdrawn from school. Around a month ago i tried taking my life. I was withdrawn from school but i wasn‚Äôt made aware of it until 3 weeks in and we already found a place for me to stay. Basically the issue is i‚Äôm not in school but i‚Äôm living in an apartment paid by my parents for me to be close to school. Now me not being enrolled is on me, i had a horrible incident that i won‚Äôt get into details but long story short, horrible experience in my first year (witnessing sewer slide, attempted murder, abuse etc.) all on my own it caused me to not perform well in my classes and i was incredibly mentally i‚Äôll - i‚Äôm not making that an excuse for my faliures but just the reason and i take full accountability of it. ( I can always clarify if you guhs have questions). This issue is, i cannot tell my parents, that‚Äôs literally a non-negotiable i‚Äôve tried and it never ends well. My parents are indian immigrants and they‚Äôve worked their butts off for me, please know i feel guilty about it all the time, i appreciate their help so much but they also are not the type to understand mental health and the second they get angry they don‚Äôt care. (ex. mom blamed brothers depression on me, told me dad once i was suicidal when i was younger and. he comforted me for him to then deny that ever happening and that i have no reason to feel that way and it‚Äôs my fault). What i‚Äôm trying to say is I can‚Äôt tell them that i have severe depression, anxiety and ptsd that resulted in my failing because to them that wouldn‚Äôt be an excuse. You guys might try to convince me and maybe this is where i‚Äôm being dense but i just know my parents and it wouldn‚Äôt work. They are not open minded at all, and to a getter their anger is justified becuase i‚Äôve wasted all their hard earned money even though yes it was out of my control i still could‚Äôve done something, i shouldn‚Äôt have been so weak. Onto why I‚Äôm making this post, when i tried, i was found by my mom and taken to the hospital. There they kept me overnight and i explained this exact situation to my psychiatrist and nurses. However when i had my meeting with my psychiatrist he told me he‚Äôs going to tell my parents there and then, i managed to convince him not to but he followed up with saying that I need to meet him in a month (currently now in like a week or so-ish) and if i haven‚Äôt told them, he‚Äôs going to send an anonymous message to my mom saying i failed uni. Now here‚Äôs the issue, i absolutely understand that in his pov this is the safest route for me but i know my family will be ruined with this info and my parents will lose it. I‚Äôve reflected and i know that this isn‚Äôt something i want to die over so i‚Äôll relay that info to my psychiatrist but i also somehow need to explain that after he threatened me with telling me parents, i tried this month to hint at my situation and they‚Äôve completely shut it down. They act like what happened didn‚Äôt ever happen. My mom has blamed me and made it about herself, just very typical i don‚Äôt believe in mental health actions. But i wanted to know, I also understand there is pt confidentiality systems set in place and him threatening only just increased my anxiety. The whole time we spoke he only continued to shame me and my feelings and mitigate them. I understand having a blunt and real approach is sometimes necessary for pts but he was completely rude and dismissive. I‚Äôm really nervous that when i go back he‚Äôs going to ignore what i say and put me into a bigger problem, i feel very lost i don‚Äôt know where to post this or where to go. If anyone has advice i‚Äôll greatly appreciate it. I know it might seem confusing and i apologize but i will do my best to clarify anything and if you guys know where else i could post this for help too. ",at my wits end
1iwtb0v,I need help I don‚Äôt have access to,MentalHealthSupport,1740370096.0,5,6,"I‚Äôm on my wits edge and i don‚Äôt know what to do

I really need this post to get at least some traction. So, I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô8‚Äù 240 ish pound male. I‚Äôve been trying to lose weight forever, but everything ends up failing. I have a calories tracker, I try to meal prep, and I try exercising. But it all ends up the same. I lose a very tiny amount of weight and then just stop. Every new time I try to lose weight, I always say ‚Äúthis is it, this is the time‚Äù but it never is. It‚Äôs like a cycle. Part of it is from having no support system. My mom doesn‚Äôt like to see me do it and it‚Äôs embarrassing to her. Professional help is way out of the question. My brother taunts and harasses me relentlessly with jokes and jabs that kill my confidence. It gets to a point where weight loss is straight up embarrassing.

Anyway, I want to outline the process from beginning to sad end so you can help me along the way. So day 1, I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to lose weight because I need it.‚Äù I meal prep, exercise, restrict my eating to about 2000 calories, and really gain confidence. It‚Äôs usually alright until about the 2 week mark, when something usually comes up. It‚Äôll be a day off, some free time, an event, anything really and it throws me off. From there, it spirals out of control. 

I feel I‚Äôve tried it all. I‚Äôve tried ‚Äújust doing it‚Äù, I‚Äôve tried telling myself one little sacrifice today is a better tomorrow, I‚Äôve tried having reminders, being insulted, etc. but NOTHING seems to work. It ends up ruining my motivation to do anything, so I end up sitting around rotting on TikTok while gaining more weight. I won‚Äôt do piano, I won‚Äôt meal prep, I won‚Äôt exercise, I won‚Äôt attempt to eat less, I won‚Äôt shower, I won‚Äôt go anywhere, I won‚Äôt clean. And then after another month the cycle starts again.

Basically all I‚Äôm saying is I‚Äôm tired of it and I‚Äôm taking the most little initiative I can by posting this. I hope this reaches good and a lot of people who can help me be better and do better. 

The complete lack of a support system is taking a toll and I feel like I‚Äôm alone and can‚Äôt confide in anyone. I‚Äôm not sure how much longer i can take being fat and disgusting.

Thanks and sorry for the long post.

1jr2z6x,I don‚Äôt think my family will survive this mental health crisis. Help?,MentalHealthSupport,1743739321.0,0,1,"So to start, I have written this post out numerous times. I write it out, download Reddit, paste it in whatever community I can find (I never use Reddit, so I don‚Äôt really know how all of it works. If I need to post in another community or you suggest a different one please let me know), then I erase it before I hit post. I think after venting about it, even to no one, I feel a little better and go back to doing what I know best: avoiding the problem. I‚Äôm posting this time around because I can‚Äôt keep this up. Im riddled with guilt everyday, depressed, anxious, overwhelmed. Nobody in my family seems to care besides me and my grandma, but shes getting too old to be any help and she‚Äôs kinda crazy too. Long story short, my mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2020. Around this time, I was in nursing school which I had to drop out to take care of her and due to my own mental health. I never went back. I cared for her for the first 2 years of her diagnosis. Took her to doctor‚Äôs appointments , all other appointments, drove her around town (trying to give her a sense of normalcy, we would go grocery shopping or get our nails done), got her everything she needed, cooked, cleaned, etc. I was her caretaker since nobody else seemed to care. My dad is in the picture but barely. I think he hates us, and I‚Äôll explain my dad in the best way I can: a verbally abusive alcoholic, narcissistic asshole, cares about money more than anything and has used money as a form of control since I was a child (my mom never worked, to which my dad held this over her head for the last 25 years always hearing ‚Äú you need to get a job, you don‚Äôt do shit around here‚Äù etc. always being shouted around the house. my mom always kept the house clean, did his laundry; did everything a wife was supposed to do. My dad has always hated her. Even to this day, he calls her names and ridicules her despite what she is going through. I think he is the reason she turned out this way, and another reason because her daughter died suddenly when she was 5. (My step sister, she died before I was born). My dad won‚Äôt leave her because of money and my mom can‚Äôt leave him because she just isn‚Äôt mentally competent anymore. To describe my mom is hard.. I love her to death but I also want to be honest about how all this affects me. And I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone but I really need someone to see me. My mom acts like a 7 year old that‚Äôs also a broken record. I haven‚Äôt had an intelligent interaction / convo with her in over 5 years. Even before it wasn‚Äôt much better, as she numbed herself with drugs and alcohol for the reminder of my childhood. I might go as far to say I‚Äôve never had a true, meaningful conversation with her, ever. Her drug of choice was vodka and Xanax (I‚Äôm sorry if this isn‚Äôt allowed but I think it‚Äôs important to the story) and she almost died a few times. Other times she almost died to suicide. She was in and out of mental hospitals when I was younger but it was all swept under the rug until 2020 when all hell broke loose. Her doctors say she went into psychosis, where she was completely detached from reality and my mom, who does not have a mean bone in her body, became violent and acted in ways like she was possessed. I actually need to go to therapy because I blocked most of this out, but when I asked about the broken mircowave my brother said she ripped the microwave out of the wall & threw it across the room. I mean, my god, you have to be pretty strong to do that right?

I also have 3 brothers, 2 younger and an older brother with Autism. Older brother is my dad‚Äôs ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù (dad‚Äôs words) I think because he‚Äôs, well, not all there ( again I‚Äôm not trying to offend anyone but please just think about it - all his kids hate him except the one who is legally a child dependent on him forever, and so easily susceptible to manipulation. he does anything my dad says. Including bully my mom.) we hate him because he has brainwashed and bullied us all of our lives. We have been manipulated for so long to sell this lie of the ‚Äúperfect family‚Äù that never existed in the first place. We live in a small town and grew up around our extended family. They know my dad is an asshole, but I don‚Äôt think they know what he‚Äôs done. Last Christmas, the family get together was so weird and strange . My mom is like this huge elephant in the room, everyone kind of tip toes around the fact that she acts so different now, not avoiding her but at the same time, not engaging with her at all. Almost like they were alienating us, I can‚Äôt think of a better way to describe it. It‚Äôs not like they were blatantly doing it but like they were all talking and having a good time WITH EACH OTHER, meanwhile we all awkwardly stand to the side. Not literally, but at the same time literally. I feel like I‚Äôm probably confusing you further but this is how it is inside of the ‚Äúfamily‚Äù, you feel these slight little jabs but they are so slight that you can‚Äôt really raise a problem about them, bc everyone is so nice with words or actions the majority of the time. So it confuses you. And makes you feel crazy for picking up on anything at all, because what is the point if you can‚Äôt say anything? I don‚Äôt know what else to say about them, besides they all dance around it because it‚Äôs not their problem, basically. But I want to scream to them ‚ÄúTHIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM AND WE ARE ALL DYING!‚Äù

If I didn‚Äôt mention it, I am married. I got married 4 months ago to the most amazing man that has saved me more than he knows. I have spilled all of this to him before and as many times as we have talked about it together, we can‚Äôt come up with any solutions. Most of our conversations end with ‚Äúyeah, I don‚Äôt know‚Äù or the classic ‚Äúwell, what do you do.‚Äù We‚Äôve basically come to the conclusion that we can‚Äôt control what other people do so it‚Äôs best to just avoid, or cut out the toxicity in your life. So when we got married, that‚Äôs what I did. Since the new year, I have only been over to that house twice. Once for my birthday and then again for Valentine‚Äôs Day. My husband suggested I cut them off because they were killing me, he said that every time I came over after being there I looked dead or like the ‚Äúlife had been sucked out of me‚Äù and it was true. I don‚Äôt know how else to explain it. Not only my mom, dad, but my brothers sucked the life out of me everyday. So he hit the nail on the head with that one. But the only thing is, now 4 months later, I don‚Äôt have the heart to block my mom. I still answer her calls sometimes. None of this is her fault and I feel guilty but she has problems that are beyond me (and as much as I‚Äôve tried to help her the doctors would never listen to me and my grandma made this difficult too in her own ways but that is a whole other story). There‚Äôs so many levels to this I feel liked id never be able to explain it all in detail, but basically my mom has been declining rapidly since her diagnosis. I don‚Äôt recognize her anymore, even physically. She doesn‚Äôt look out of her eyes the same she almost stares straight through you. I saw a glimpse of her on Easter last year but it went away just as fast as it came. There are days where I hate my mom, where I wish death on her, and then I feel bad about it. I am NEVER mean to my mother to her face, aside from my teen years, because she doesn‚Äôt deserve it. I just let her be, take it as best I can, and then scream about it later to myself or to my husband. I think she might have dementia the way that she repeats herself often or asks the same questions over and over. The doctors just say she has schizophrenia bc she is only 55. I stopped trying to get through to her, like I really believe that my mom is long gone and that I‚Äôll never see her again. I feel like she is already dead except I still get non-stop texts from her all day, everyday, I mean like they never stop. (I have her muted, but haven‚Äôt brought myself to block her) Calls come every hour on the hour. I got a message once that my iPhone storage was full, come to find my messages are taking up all storage on my phone. I delete my mom‚Äôs texts because duh, and it crashed my phone. When it came to, 55,000 text messages sat in my recently deleted. My phone crashed again when I deleted it from that folder. The thing is I always tried to text her at least once a day, but there have been days even weeks where I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to text her at all. And it really doesn‚Äôt matter because Nothing stops her sporadic and incessant messages. I kind of just gave up because I ain‚Äôt reading all that. I decided to include some of these messages here. she will still repeat herself 100s of times. I‚Äôve told her that, how text messages works, is that they are always there for me to see. so if I don‚Äôt reply, then I will still see the message and reply when I can. She will basically send the same thing over and over again until I answer. It‚Äôs harassing and overwhelming, I get sick thinking about what she writes. Sometimes when I take a peek, I‚Äôm filled with dread at the things she says
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to be here much longer‚Äù, 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm the only mom you are ever going to have‚Äù 
‚Äúplease  come see me‚Äú 
‚Äúare you coming?‚Äù 
‚ÄúPlease come‚Äù ‚Äú
‚Äúcome‚Äù 
‚ÄúDads mean to me‚Äù
‚Äúare you coming‚Äù 
‚Äúcome today or tomorrow‚Äù 
‚Äúplease are you coming?‚Äù  

Guilt trip after guilt trip, and constantly begging me to come see her. She tells people I don‚Äôt come see her and then everyone makes me out to be the bad guy. She also writes these letters to me and my husband Every. Single. Day. I have deleted the majority of her text messages. But I will include some from within the last month

I am begging for even a light at the end of the tunnel, because even though I am out of it I have still not escaped and I don‚Äôt know if I ever will. My father in law tells me stories about how he relates, as his dad has dementia and treated him terribly. But then again, he is 50 something and I am 27. His dad is 80, my mom is 55. To me, it doesn‚Äôt seem relatable because  I have just began my own life, trying to anyway with my new husband and navigating this as a young adult. Most people my age don‚Äôt have to worry about their parents. I‚Äôve had to raise mine even to this day. My dad does nothing but work, drink, and abuse everyone in the house. He acts like such a victim saying things like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt handle this anymore, your mom is insane‚Äù or crying about the next thing. He is a terrible human being in my opinion, a mean old nasty drunk who is good for nothing except for his money. (Did I mention he is a millionaire? And he still won‚Äôt get my mom the help she needs?) CAN I SUE MY FUCKING DAD AT THIS POINT?? 

I think I‚Äôll end it here ‚Äî please let me know if I need to elaborate or give more to the story but I don‚Äôt want to keep rambling. I feel like I explained the most important parts and how I keep getting sucked back into their world. Whether it‚Äôs my own guilt eating me alive or something else, idk if I can keep on doing this but I don‚Äôt know what else to do. Is avoiding it stupid? Or is going back over there stupid? Do I have to do anything at all? (I know the answer is probably no, but it‚Äôs not so black and white , I think about my mom, mentally ill deserving of the proper care and instead still getting abused day in and day out.) Who do you call for stuff like this ? The police has never helped, doctors don‚Äôt help, I‚Äôve even had a bad experience with a lawyer. (Claimed we needed all of my father‚Äôs assets to qualify for divorce, and surprise, he would not give them to us. lol) the lawyer refused to help us further, even after hearing her story. I think I‚Äôm at my wits end, I have exhausted all efforts to the best of my abilities. 

TLDR: my mom is schizophrenic and still getting abused by my dad. I am finally out of the house and married trying to start my own life but feel like I keep getting sucked back in. I am getting eaten alive with guilt but don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. ",at my wits end
1jq0q9o,"Criticize me, recommend me, help me improve my life! How to reconnect with myself?",MentalHealthSupport,1743630137.0,0,1,"Hello everyone and thank you for helping me on my self-improvement journey. Firstly i want to apologize for possible mistakes in this text, i am not a native english speaker and I'd like to ask you for constructive criticism and decent answers, I'm trying to find valid sources that have really helped some people with similar problems. Professionals opinions are welcomed! i will start with my background - I am a 21 year old slavic girl who is going through her 2nd year of bachelor studies in some sort of healthcare science (unrelated right now). 

My childhood wasnt the nicest. I dont remember much, but i can tell you what i do. My parents got divorced when i was just a baby and both remarried and had other kids. My mom didnt have the best taste in men, so i ended up mentally abused by her ex husband and i had to witness domestic violence through my childhood, while trying to protect my little sister (his daughter) from seeing how dysfunctional we were at that time. I was used to listen to constant shouting, arguing, threads, humiliation and accusations in this household. I was the person my mom talked with about her problems, i was the one who was trying to convince her to leave when i saw new bruises on her, but we always had to get back. She didnt care much about what i do or how i feel, how hurt or exhausted i was from this life. When i needed something she had her own problems or she paid attention just to my little sister. She wasnt much in her mom role in those years, it was just me. My dad also remarried and had kids. I wouldnt ever say that he doesnt love me, he more like doesnt get it. At first i was visiting his house every other weekend, but with time he stopped losing interest in reaching out to me, so we went for weeks without seeing each other to eventually even months. Since i was like fifteen he says that its my duty to try to be in their life, he wont call by himself or even invite me to birthdays (and then its my fault i dont show up even though i didnt know), he just isnt interested. He has his own family and i get it, what makes me sad is the thing that he says that its not true. My mom also has her own kids and i can see i never belonged to any of these families even though i tried my best. I was always shy bookworm, i was scared to talk and i had problems socializing with kids my age. After my mom got divorced (and it was a nasty one) i started taking antidepressants (i was 12/13). I became so numb and from already confused girl became total weirdo with loads of anxiety, panic attacks and depression. I even did whole high school from home because i wasnt okay. I didnt know or understood myself, dated badly, had messed emotions and did everything to be liked. I didnt have many friends and my honesty and nerdy interests didnt help that at all. These things were frustrating as hell

Last year something in me clicked. I was in university, trying to work and study and live normally, but then i figure out i dont know who i am. I broke up with my passive boyfriend, got out of antidepressants and birth control. And i was like - i dont have any hobbies, i dont know what i like, i dont remember much about myself. My short and long term memory is almost non existent, i cant focus or think logically. Social skills are terrible too. I am still much number than other people, still like i have bubbly foil around myself, but i can feel. I met someone who made me feel much more and that person is a big part of my motivation. I want to work on my anxiety, lack of self-worth and confidence, overthinking, my nonability to feel fully. I want to know what i really like. I am trying working out currently for all of the benefits it can bring and my friend (who is also a PT) saw that i had problems with feeling that burning pain when lifting and that i am on the edge of breakdown when i lift, so we talked and agreed that i am really disconnected from my body and myself in general. He recommended me this book Trauma and soul by D. Kalsched and i am so looking forward to make myself better. 

So please people of reddit, do you have book/yt/blog/podcast recommendations or any other valuable advice for me? I take everything, i am so eager to evolve myself because this world deserves better me.

I will add more posts about this topic in future, so people who are in similar position stay tuned! we are not lost and we deserve better <3",at my wits end

1jat5mm,Constant Hobby Bouncing Is Ruining My Relationship,MentalHealthSupport,1741917827.0,1,1,"Hi, all. I'm a 33 year old woman. Up until a year or two ago, I really didn't have any interests outside of reading, playing video games, and watching TV. I work, but never really gave it my all. Basically if it wasn't super interesting, I couldn't care less. Mingle in with this that the things I was SUPPOSED to do, I'd always do them half-way if I did them at all. A little over a year ago though, I went to a regular medical doctor and made a joke about never remembering anything because I HAVE to make a reminder on my phone for anything or it didn't happen, and she asked me a number of questions. At that point, she diagnosed me with ADHD and a binge eating disorder (which is definitely true) and prescribed me Vyvanse. My significant other thinks I should see a psychiatrist to prove I actually have ADHD, but honestly that's not the main problem. For the past year or two, it's like I pick something and I want to do it CONSTANTLY. Then, I basically shut down every other aspect of my life, focus completely on that one thing, get tired of it, set it aside, and two weeks later it's something else. Before it was crocheting, then it was diamond painting, and right now, it's making customizable trading cards and bookmarks and such (again reading is the one hobby I've never put down, basically since I learned how to read I've been reading). My boyfriend owns a business and I work there. He's been coming into work in the morning and seeing little scraps of paper all over the place from where I'm trying to learn how to make everything properly sized and such, and then scrap paper that I printed and messed up that I'm just using as an in-between layer now to add thickness to cards/not totally waste all of the paper. He's at his wits end. He thinks I'm either depressed or just generally unhappy with my life and that's why I'm like this, but for the most part I feel fairly happy. I have always kind of been the type of person that felt like I wasn't much of anything but wanted to be, if that makes sense, but haven't actually put the effort into being those things. Idk what's wrong with me. My boyfriend has put up with my shortcomings for sixteen years, and of course I don't want to lose him, and I don't want to upset him either, as he has his own health issues that really require him to stay calm as much as he can. Should I seek therapy? Am I just beyond broken? I feel lost, and worthless, and stupid. ",at my wits end
1j1hcqm,I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore no,MentalHealthSupport,1740885379.0,0,1,"Hello, friends. I‚Äôve been stuck in a really bad depression for a few years now and I‚Äôm at my wits ends, haha. 

I was diagnosed with depression bipolar 2 at 12, I am now almost 25 and diagnosed with a mood and personality disorders, and it‚Äôs been a constant struggle to say the least. However, I can say without a doubt that I have never been this low or desperate for escape. I spent time keeping myself going with the little things in life, how the loss of my life would affect my loved ones, all the sweet memories I have, all the memories I‚Äôll make, and so on. When that stopped working, I started telling myself that I have no choice but to stay alive. Like what else am I going to do except get out of bed and keep going? I‚Äôve been to therapy, I recently stopped seeing my therapist due to me moving states, however I did recently ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù from an intensive outpatient program. I should not have left the program. I am not better‚Äî at all. 

I‚Äôm looking for a therapist and even made an appointment with an office to discuss a more urgent medicinal therapy. But I don‚Äôt have the energy anymore, wholeheartedly. I made the appointment and research therapists as an obligation to others. And I don‚Äôt care to keep trying. I know I‚Äôd be considered selfish, and I don‚Äôt care. I know it‚Äôll tear people apart, but I can barely breathe. I am sobbing probably 5 hours of the day, every single day. I can hardly stomach food anymore. I haven‚Äôt been able to hold a conversation in years. I can barely interact with the herbal public positively. And I don‚Äôt know how to get intervention if I don‚Äôt really want it. My insurance isn‚Äôt great, I work 40+ hours a week, I‚Äôm broke, and I‚Äôm over it.

1iylfki,I don't even know what to do anymore,MentalHealthSupport,1740569442.0,0,1,"For reference i live with my parents and it has been a journey and i think im at my wit's end. Recently my mother went to go settle some family business so i am left alone with my father which should be alright except for the fact that hes extremely toxic and has practically been abusing me all my life. Yes there are some fun moments but you cant expect me to ignore all the red flags in what he has done to me. he admitted to wanting to bug my phone without my consent, he wanted to hit me on multiple occasions. He tried to restrict me from texting with my friends or play video games. Its horrible. The worst part is that he has done stuff either like this or worse before. once i was using my headphones and he hit me so hard on the side of the face i bled. He threatened to take my phone away which would be fine if not for the fact that it was my only outlet! it was my only support system and taking it away made me feel horrible. I didnt want to wear dresses without sleeves since they made me insecure(i had been raped but he doesnt know) but instead of understanding and allowing little me to wear some comfortable clothing i was told to shut up and got a slap instead. Now this seems totally out of topic, which to be fair kinda is since i just started ranting but with all the shit hes doing like taking away any and all support systems ans just pushing me to study my life away i dont think i can handle this anymore. Like it get it education is important but i can also study using my laptop, theres so many resources out there but he ignores all that and asks me to read a textbook that is barely ever used in class. I get yelled at every day and sometimes get hit too and I just feel like its too much. These days ive been getting urges to self harm or just die but i know the friends ive made would be upset so ive tried to hang on but as days go by im starting to wonder if i can actually hang on anymore. Ive struggled with suicidal thoughts since i was young but ive always stopped myself from harming myself since i care about other people and didnt want to see my mother getting hurt because of me but now i just dont think i can keep going anymore. I just want to end all this and just die already but i feel guilty for even thinking such a thing. I still love my father a little even though there were times when he dehumanized me, calling me an ""investment"" but hes still my father and all i wish is to just escape all this. To just die and start fresh or something. ",at my wits end
1iy2v0r,Flip flopping on whether or not the basement is my friend or foe.,MentalHealthSupport,1740510185.0,0,1,"This post is extremely messy so do forgive me, here goes. >!&#x200B;!<

All of this really starts around the end of my final semester of community college. I did cyber security, learned that I hated it and decided I need a change but wasn't sure if I should've done programming or air craft maintenance. At the same time I was scared to admit to my dad that I wanted to join the military, our relationship had been rocky for several years and the fact that things were going well now meant that I didn't want to rock the boat by saying I wanted to enlist. I decided do this semester at a local branch of a big name state university only to find out it was all online at that point.

Fast forwards to around January and I feel horrible. I felt like I wasted the past several years in my basement and I feel a genuine sense of bitterness towards myself and the mistakes I've made. I feel my mental health slipping for the first time in about a year and eventually when I put on my uniform to go to civil air patrol I'm reminded of that childhood dream of joining the military and that night I broke down and told my dad I wanted to enlist. He freaked out and couldn't handle the fact I wanted to drop college and enlist.

My reason for enlisting at the time was rather simple: I was tired of paying others to tell me stuff I already had an idea of at the least, at worst I knew more than, and then going to my basement devoid of human contact to do work. I wanted to be outside, I wanted to be around people, I wanted to get some sort of prestige, and if I enlisted as an army helicopter pilot (despite how hard it might be) I'd have something equally if not more valuable than a degree.

For most of February I've just been having a rough time coping with online schooling, not because it was new as that had been all of community college, but because I now saw a way out. I was disgusted by my basement, I broke down every now and then when I saw my reflection as I could only see the man who ruined my life. Then yesterday I decided I would work out a little bit, just push ups and my usual three mile run. I did it and when I woke up at midnight because I went to sleep at nine my body was sore. I wondered if I should've done work, prove I could handle getting up early. I didn't. I just did nothing and went back to sleep when I next felt tired at 4 AM. Then I woke up with my alarm at 9:30 and decided right then that I wanted to stay in the basement.

I want to stay in the basement simply because I don't have to change who I am. I can be the lazy slob I've been for the past three years without much consequence. Honestly I think I hated the basement so much I wrapped back around to liking it and I'm content to rot down here. Honestly this is the best I've felt in a while.

I don't know what to do and my dad is at his wit's end right now. I've been pushing off therapy because it would get in the way of the military but since my desire is now to rot in the basement and to aspire to nothing I don't really care if I do. What advice do you guys have?

TL;DR: hated virtual school, wanted to enlist, realized that working out and getting up early require hard work and discipline, and then I decide I want to stay in the basement.",at my wits end

1jm0brj,One aspect of autism that I find to be painfully lonely and isolating.,MentalHealthSupport,1743182386.0,8,6,"I am 38. I was only diagnosed with autism last year. 

One of the harsh realities of autism is basically you are told you are different and other people do not see the world the way you see it.

Nothing like being an adult and being told you will never quite fit in. 

At first it explains a lot. Like why no girl has ever liked me. And it explains how despite trying to get into a relationship over and over again I got nowhere.

The next thought is a bit more concerning though. What if no one ever likes me? What if I will always be completely isolated and alone? I certainly know finding someone to connect with and relate with will be a titanic struggle.

I guess the other tough aspect that I have never seen expressed anywhere is that I cannot use my own thoughts as a guide to explain the action of others. I think normally we understand others through ourselves. 

Since I am so different from others it seems very difficult for me to look inward to explain the action of others. Which is exactly what I had been doing all my life. And now that I know I am at least a little bit different.

It makes things that much lonelier and isolating. Feels like I really am alone. Like I said I find this aspect of autism to be scary and isolating. ",lonely

1jca5se,Only one person came to my birthday celebration tonight and I feel so bitterly depressed and lonely. How do I go forward?,MentalHealthSupport,1742087544.0,9,12,"Tonight was my birthday celebration and only one person showed up. We did our best to have a good time but it felt awkward and I wish I hadn't bothered.

I'm both depressed and extremely angry about this, even though most people dropped out for legit reasons but a few others were flakes who I think could have communicated better with me. I'm not actually angry at anyone in particular as nobody owes me their time but I am absolutely fed up to absolute death of not feeling like a priority in anyone's life. I attended multiple friend's 30ths recently where dozens of people showed up for a big dance hall party and I have to deal with basically nobody in my life celebrating me? I've brought this feeling up on Reddit before and some replies amounted to 'why are you as a grown man upset nobody came to your birthday? What are you, a child?' which doesn't help this feeling and frankly is a c**ty thing to say.

It's on me to improve this for myself, as I am admittedly absolutely terrible at making meaningful connections with people out of fear and growing up with worthless role models. But I cannot keep living like this, I am so fucking lonely and change feels impossible. I will no doubt get loads of messages and questions asking how it went and I don't know how to react honestly without looking like a bitter asshole or a giant loser. I don't know how to change my life and be honest in making better connections and relationships with people because I don't know how to value myself in these moments.

(They say they can't risk being friends with me, even though we get along fine or at least we have recently.) I feel like I'm always helping my friends and giving them advice, but they never do the same for me. I used to be so mean to people but I am so much better now and people don't seem to care. I can't make friends easily, I'm autistic and I have social anxiety. I've been dealing with this crippling loneliness and depression for years now. I feel so miserable everyday. I just need someone to listen and I don't have anyone to talk about it with. Whenever I act like I am doing bad no one knows what to do. Hardly anybody answers my messages (when I'm trying to have normal conversations) and I don't know how to deal with it. I love my friends too much to let go. ",lonely

1i7e790,Hoping for advice as I struggle with extreme sadness,MentalHealthSupport,1737561097.0,8,5,"Hi all, 

I am  just going to see if this will help I guess. I am 30 years old now and have been struggling with extreme sadness lately. I have always had my bouts with this but always feel that it was more situational vs a chemical imbalance or something like that.. 

It‚Äôs hard to put my finger on one thing and feels like there are a slew of things that are creating this sadness lately and maybe it is the dead of old man winter that is making things feel extra overbearing lately. I am not sure.  

My mom passed of cancer in 2016 and my dad passed of lung disease in 2022. I just bought and moved into my first home this past October. I got a chocolate lab which was the dog we had for 13 years of my childhood that we loved dearly. Lately I find myself in gut wrenching emotional pain because there are so many things wish I could show them or ask them about. This is odd to me because why now? I mean, I‚Äôve definitely broken down and cried at some random moments because of this before but lately it is like every single day is just so painful all day long. I can‚Äôt focus on work or enjoy things that would normally make me happy. I find myself wishing that I could cook with my mom and have her taste recipes of my own. Wishing I could ask my dad for advice around woodworking or car restoration. I wonder what they would think of my dog and I visualize how much they would probably love him and how cool it would be to be together in my house for dinners and visits. I almost wonder if I am just looking for someone to tell me that they are proud of me. I have a handful of older cousins who have told me this, but it‚Äôs almost like it is not as meaningful as it would be coming from my parents. 

I have a small handful of very close friends and while we are close, I don‚Äôt really feel comfortable talking to them for some reason. I prefer to be alone than to be around them.  It is almost like I feel more alone around some of my friends because I feel like some of them really don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm going through or they don‚Äôt understand how to process these kinds of emotions. Despite them being some of my best friends, I just feel sad that I don‚Äôt have that sort of deep connection with them where I can express this without being judged. I feel that they listen to respond and they don‚Äôt listen to understand. They are surface level thinkers in my opinion but have been there for me for over a decade and have supported me for which I am grateful. 

I have also been very overweight my entire life. I lost 175lbs and looked and felt incredible during that time 2016-2018. The girl who was my best friend that I actually loved ended up having feelings for me too. It felt like a movie, as if things were falling into place exactly as they should. She had been contemplating for a long time whether or not she wanted to move across the country to be with her sister though‚Ä¶ and ultimately that is what she did which left me heartbroken for five or six years, and I have gained back all the weight that I‚Äôve lost. 

There are questions that I have, things I wish I could‚Äôve said or done, and things that I wish I could say or do now that I just can‚Äôt. 

I feel empty and worthless. I have no one to really make proud anymore. I fight to achieve goals for myself but the more I achieve, the more sad I feel because I just feel alone in my successes such as buying a home, getting a better career or beginning to lose weight again. It feels like if I were to die, others would move on with their lives after 2 weeks or so and no one would remember me. No matter how many times I‚Äôve made them laugh and no matter how many things I have achieved or created. 

I hope that this is just a period of sadness that I need to understand and figure out that will eventually pass. It has been a month and a half now. ",sad

1jjqcel,I had the baddest panic attack in my adult life and now am scared it will happen again...,MentalHealthSupport,1742927034.0,1,1,"#TRIGGER WARNING! Bad case of panic attack!






I've been out for a bit shopping. I was already trying to calm me down from anxiety.

Backstory:

A few months ago my body went full Parkinson mode from taking Lithium and quitting it too fast. I ended up in the neurology ward of our hospital where I underwent a CT, Lumbar Punction and MRI and they found nothing neurological. But still gave me Levodopa. Which I am still taking. The symptoms vanished and I am at my physical normal. Which really is nice.

But lately I have breathing issues. For example I wake up gasping for air and/or having to force my body to breathe again. That scares me. Do I probably have sleep apnea? But sometimes it even feels as if my body is just too lazy and then I have to breathe manually.

I am about to see a lung specialist.

My doctor said that the dose of the Levodopa seems to high. Also it's listed in the side effects that it can have an effect on breathing. I should talk to a neurology doctor. Great. I almost immediately got a panic attack then. They managed to calm me down.

Since then I am just more scared. Sometimes I am just chilling and starting to feel dizzy and have to take a DEEP breath. It's as if I just stopped breathing without noticing. Just now I had it again while I was typing this out.

Fast forward to this afternoon:

I wanted to go shopping. Look for summer clothes. When I was at home I already felt weird. Tried to shake it off and stay calm. But then I was in the shop. I walked around growing more and more concerned. Thinking of asking the staff if I can sit down somewhere. But instead I went outside. Wanted to sit down on a bench. As soon as I started to walk I felt dizzy. I thought I will pass out. I thought if I do in public people would steal my stuff so I decided to go into a Caf√© and order a water.

Inside I stopped and thought of asking for help. I looked at the staff helplessly while turning off my headphones. They didn't notice at all that I was highly unwell. I looked for a table and went there. Sat down. Felt bad. Anxiety rising.

A server came up to me and asked if I am okay. I just told him I think I am having a panic attack. He asked if I want water and I nodded. He brought it. I couldn't move my fingers anymore. I asked for a straw. He brought one. I asked him to stay with me. He did. Tried to calm me down and said he knows how that is.

That's when it happened. My whole body except my eye area and the back of my head started tingling like mad. My hands and fingers cramped and stiffened and I couldn't move them at all anymore. My lung started tingling. I was scared I would die. I couldn't breathe. I got loud. Other guests looked at me. Told me to breathe calmly. Asked if we need water. The server said we have it already. Thanked them.

I couldn't move my face anymore. I barely could talk. It was so scary.

When I finally calmed down I apologized to the guests and they assured me it was okay. One even offered to order a tea but I politely declined saying I had my water and that's enough. I thanked her.

When that attack started the server called an ambulance. I asked him if they were finally there. Until I saw them.

They brought me to the hospital where I am right now waiting for a psych doc. They drew blood from me thrice to look at my oxygen level. Thrice because the first two times they accidentally drew from my vein instead of artery. They checked my blood pressure and my oxygen level with this test thingy you get put on your finger.

I don't know if I have to stay the night. I don't know how I come back home. Thankfully our town is pretty walkable tho. So if I have to I can walk back to my bicycle and then go home.

But I am scared. Scared that it will happen again and that there is nobody to stay with me even tho I have housemates. Scared that I will pass out or worse.

I've had panic attacks since childhood but they have never been like this. I screamed when I had them and I thought I was dying. But I never cramped. Ever. Until a few months ago. I was so scared. And today was the first time it was THAT bad. I couldn't even really move my arms anymore.

When I was in the hospital and finally could move again my arms had a bad tremor. I was scared I would have that permanently now but it's gone now. My fingers still tingle but I am breathing normal (I think).

I hope the doctor can help me. At least for now.",panic attacks

Long story short, I went to a teacher (she is the coach of our class but not she is not my coach but she is like a half coach so i still went to her cause my coach was sick) and I tell her ""yeah so during your test i had one of these panic attacks in my head"" and she looks at me and is like ""yeahhh that sucks. Anyways i know you struggle with my subject so-"" EXCUSE ME. A student just told you they have panic attacks and you say that üò≠ So eventually I did go to my own coach, luckily she was more serious and she got me to talk with the school music teacher and my old coach (she is a teacher that kids go to when they have mental problem). I have been talking with her since January and what have we established? That I am really on the edge! And that I clearly need help to a point that my coach and her are concerned.

I have this friend (C) who has struggled with their mental health for as long as I've know them. C is very nice and I love being their friend. but recently they have frequently had panic attacks in the middle of class, between classes, at lunch, etc.  It's constant and I've tried asking them if they wanted to talk about it or if there is any triggers to their panic attacks and every time I ask they never want to talk about it or tell me how I can help them when they are in these situations. I feel like i'm walking on eggshells because I don't know what could be triggering to them. 

I'm very worried about my friend but at the same time, I can't stop worrying when the next panic attack will be when I'm with them. I've also been finding myself trying to get to my next class as quickly as possible to try to avoid witnessing the next panic attack because witnessing those situations really fuck up my brain for a couple days because it will keep replaying in my head, over, and over again. I can usually feel what others feel just by looking at them, so seeing C like that is very emotionally draining, and I don't know what to do. I've had my own issues with my mental health before and I really don't want to go back into my old state of mind.

I'm the person who can usually find the solutions and give good advice but I'm terrible at comforting people when they are crying or in a mental state like a panic attack. I've had to get teachers both times I was the only person with C because I just don't know how to help the situation or if I can help.

Hi. I (20, Genderqueer) have been struggling badly with depression since I was 14, and with anorexia for the past year. A sudden dramatic event in my life made me realise I needed to get better because I was hurting people I loved. However since I've started working on improving myself- went to the doctor to get supplements for any nutrient deficiencies, working on eating more (slow but steady progress yk), making small changes to my life, and looking for a therapist.

But ever since I started working on things I keep experiencing really horrible panic attacks, which I've never had before. Even when my depression was at its worst I never had any issues with anxiety. But now it's almost a nightly routine of hyperventilating, sobbing and throwing up and frankly I'm sick of it. Is this normal? Is there anything that could explain it? And also, how can I manage/prevent them?",panic attacks

I‚Äôve tried melatonin which made me feel sleepy but didn‚Äôt actually help me fall and stay asleep. Sleeping pills helped me fall asleep but I would wake up every hour with vivid dreams and feel super groggy the next day.

1gojq0i,Advice on Burnout/Cortisol Addiction? Depression? ,MentalHealthSupport,1731298645.0,0,1,"Hi, and if you're taking the time to read this, thank you so much, I appreciate it!

I'm a 17 y/o Hispanic American female currently in my senior year of pretty intense college prep high school; I have ADHD, as well as OCD and Anxiety, all of which I have struggled with all four years. Despite my mental health struggles, I have been able to keep my 4.0, be in the top 10% of my class, stay involved in extracurriculars, and do pretty well on testing, which has given me the chance to apply to some very competitive colleges.

I was told my senior year would be the ""fun"" year, so that's kind of what I've been holding onto through tough times in high school; that soon, I'll be in my senior year and will finally be able to let loose and have fun and spend more time with my friends. But so far, my senior year has been anything but. I'm in 4 APs, doing research, leading student government, and MUN. I'm at meetings most lunches which I hate because lunch is when I get to see my friends.

At the beginning of this year, I thought, ""I just gotta lock in really hard for these first two months, submit all of my college apps, and then I'll be done and I can finally relax after."" So I did...initially. I was waking up on the weekends at 6 am to work, and I'd work all day and seemingly never finish my work; everything takes me longer (thanks, ADHD!) But even then, I still felt fulfilled and motivated to wake up early and work. When Nov 1 rolled around, I didn't feel the immense sense of relief I'd expected when I submitted my ED/EA applications...just fear for the results/decisions. I've applied to 9/14 of my colleges and have the last couple of deadlines on November 15th, so I know I should be feeling a little more relieved, but I've been feeling so...unmotivated... sad, and overall down.

I'm usually motivated to study because I want to do well on assignments and, honestly because I'm usually interested in the material and like learning. But th se past couple of weeks I just...can't. I spent HOURS doing literally nothing and trying to build up the energy/motivation to study. And even when I try to sit down to do work or study, I always get sleepy! I'm SO TIRED all of the time. Like just today I took like 2, 4 hour naps. I have a lot I want to get done (and get off my plate so I can try to relax), so I try waking up early on weekends, but I end up wasting most of the time and just can't do my work. This makes me feel even unmotivated, guilty, and mad at myself because I have very high expectations for myself, and when I can't reach them, I feel like a failure (which ik isn't great.)

I've been getting less and less sleep, seeing my friends less and less, biting my nails more, and not making time to work out or eat as healthy as I would like. But despite this, I'm also not even getting any work done/being productive, so I just feel lost in an endless cycle of homework, tests, and application deadlines, all while not seeing my friends. My grades haven't started to slip yet, but I'm worried at the rate things are going because I CAN'T find it in me to want to work. Even sadder I think I've lost some of the passion and curiosity I usually feel towards learning. I'm in AP Physics (which I hate, omg, like I have never been so simultaneously uninterested and terrible at a subject), and the results of the recent election \*cough cough\* have been very stressful on my family and me, so that could be contributing to some of the burnout? Idk. 



I don't usually post here on Reddit, but I have literally no idea what to do. I think this must be burnout, right? Or like a cortisol addiction? If it is, what do I do?! I want to be happy, feel less stressed and enjoy my last year of high school w my friends. And I really want to feel the excitement learning things in school used to bring me, but I don't know how to anymore.

If you somehow read all of this, thank you so much; I know it was a lot.

I would really really appreciate some advice on what I should do

Hi, I‚Äôm 28 years old and I had my first panic attack a year ago. It was terrifying, but having my family with me helped. I experienced anxiety for nearly a week before seeing a doctor and getting medication.

Background Info:
I had a webshop and worked part-time in a store, which caused me daily stress. I was frequently sick, so I had my blood tested multiple times, but nothing was wrong. One day, I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed to go to work. I felt extremely ill and went to the emergency doctor, who told me my body was fine but I was stressed.

On day six of constant panic and stomach aches, I visited my doctor. They prescribed medication and referred me to a therapist who diagnosed me with panic attacks and said I was close to burnout. I had to stop working, and my job contract wasn‚Äôt renewed. I also had to close my webshop. I felt like a failure.

Months later, I was getting better and decided to find a new job. I started working as a receptionist with a 10-hour workday, but after a couple of days and a stressful wedding weekend, the panic attacks returned. I went back to my therapist and slowly improved again. I continued with daily activities like walking, reading, grocery shopping, and going to the gym.

My boyfriend surprised me with a vacation. The start of the trip was rough‚ÄîI panicked at the airport and during the first night at the hotel, mainly due to lack of sleep. But after a few days, I adjusted and had an amazing road trip. I‚Äôve been back for almost two weeks now, and despite some jet lag, I‚Äôm doing okay.

I have appointments with someone to assess if I‚Äôm ready to work again. When I shared my vacation experience (exaggerating the bad parts), they told me I might have to live with panic attacks for life and need intensive therapy. This worried me alot (please don't tell me because i understand this won‚Äôt go away overnight)

Triggers:

- Professionals emphasizing the severity of my burnout and anxiety.
- Stressful appointments and thoughts about future work.
-Big events, like vacations.
- My self-esteem

I know I need to push through the tough days, but I just want to feel fine without those panic days. I‚Äôm scared of having a panic attack at work and being labeled as ""the sick girl."" I‚Äôm confident in my ability to work and do a good job, but I don‚Äôt want to be seen as fragile.

I‚Äôm looking for tips to boost my confidence and manage my stress better. How can I reassure myself that I‚Äôll be fine, especially during those initial days back at a new job..

And I‚Äôm pretty healthy to be honest. I‚Äôm 5 11 I weigh 173lbs I don‚Äôt eat junk food I haven‚Äôt been exercising the way I‚Äôm suppose to but I‚Äôm in decent shape. So I know it‚Äôs a mental thing. (Luckily I have an understanding gf) I don‚Äôt have the best relationship with either of my parents. 

Earlier this month I decided to give liquor a try again.  
And let me tell you I started feeling a euphoric feeling after my first 2 glasses. My gf was surprised to see me in a good mood. Usually she talked me to sleep but this time I was the talker and she listened to me. I literally explain to this girl why I loved her so much (unfiltered conversation) I felt confident and not over thinking anything. We had great sex that night I didn‚Äôt have any trouble getting my Johnson up I felt good and I was just so relaxed about everything and just happy. My anxiety was absent I couldn‚Äôt hear shit my inner critic had to say to fuck up the moment. And honestly I can control my drinking I will never become an addict I know how to cope without it even if it‚Äôs very difficult to actually relax and be present. But I don‚Äôt think it will be wrong to take a couple glasses every now and then. And I know us men barely have a shoulder to cry on sometimes and we have no other option to turn to the liquor and drink our problems away. ALCOHOL IS NOT THE SOLUTION GUYS!!! DRINK IN MODERATION.

I just know it is getting so bad, so now I just want to find something to help me get through this and feel better and normal at least.

I've read Cerebral is a fraud: I saw they accept FSA/HSA, but not sure now if I can even trust them.

h0bxde,[Mod Approved] Paid study ($15 in Amazon Gift cards) -- alcohol use (or opiate use) and thoughts of suicide,MentalHealthSupport,1591798732.0,0,3,"**Who I am:** Hello, everyone! I am a graduate student at the University of Toledo. I spent 4 years working with service members at the Walter Reed military base in Maryland and I‚Äôm now in training to work at recovery services in a Toledo hospital. As a result of these, and other personal experiences, suicide prevention and substance harm reduction are topics I care very much about.

**What the study entails:** The study is two online surveys: the first one now (1 hour, compensation: $10 Amazon gift card) and second six months from now (30 min, compensation: $5 Amazon gift card), so **$15 total in Amazon gift cards**. We ask that folks not complete the first survey unless they expect to complete the second, as the study relies on both. Participation is confidential and voluntary.

**Eligibility:** 18+, living in the US, have considered suicide in the past year, and would consider yourself to be in one of the following groups: (1) using alcohol has been giving you problems in the past year or (2) using opiates has been giving you problems in the past year. The first couple minutes is a screener to confirm eligibility.

**Survey Link:** Please send me a DM or chat message with your email for a personal link. The link will hold your place if you pause and resume over 7 days.

**Study Goal:** In brief, the ultimate goal of the study is to develop better interventions for folks who may be considering suicide. The specific goal is to determine what different treatment needs may exist between folks using opiates, using alcohol, or not using substances. *To this end, we ask for detailed information on alcohol/substance use and suicide as this provides the clearest information on if/how they are related and what treatment needs exist.*

**Questions?**: If you have any questions, or accidentally click on something that takes you out of the survey prematurely, please send me a DM, reply to this thread, or email me directly: [Utoledostudy@gmail.com](mailto:Utoledostudy@gmail.com).

Hello! I am just here to vent and maybe seek an answer to what I am experiencing. 

I am 19 and in my first year of university. For the last two years I feel like I haven‚Äôt felt at peace with myself. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm depressed as I have constant mood changes. I used to have mood swings pretty often but for the past half a year they started happening daily. There are times when my mood changes drastically several times a day without a specific reason. The feelings are usually pretty extreme. I am either on cloud 9 or feel like I want to end it all. These mood swings are also noticeable as my roommate pointed them out. 

I feel like I‚Äôm always craving a feeling, like I‚Äôm always waiting for something but I don‚Äôt know what. I have no interest in relationships anymore due to a lot of heart break in the past, so it‚Äôs not even about connection.

I feel like being away from home also impacts my mood significantly. The only thing that I feel truly made me feel better was driving around my city. Speeding made me feel pretty good, whenever I was alone of course. The rush of adrenaline was satisfying. But now I don‚Äôt have that anymore, as my car is at home. 

I‚Äôve had problems with addiction as well. Besides smoking, I used to find my solace in pot until I started to rely on it too much whenever I had problems. I was able to quit a year ago, but found myself relying on alcohol after that. I used to drink almost every day which I feel made me hate myself more due to an alcohol addiction in one of my family members. After an incident when I self harmed when I got too drunk I tried to drink less which has worked so far. 

I feel like I have no one to talk to about all of this as I know everyone has their own issues. I don‚Äôt want to be a burden to the people around me. I do journaling which does help in the moment. 

I am afraid everything I do is in vein. I feel sick with myself as I am overwhelmed by stress and pretty much everything. I‚Äôm sorry for rambling so much but thank you for reading. Every comment would really be helpful. ",substance abuse

I‚Äôm proud to say I‚Äôve been doing much better with my mental health after a few years of therapy but I‚Äôve noticed that now that I‚Äôm doing better (and have more time to think about other things) that self-destruction is like an addiction.

I am now dealing with emotions I now have time to process alongside mourning the years that my disorders stole from me. 

So my question is, what is a healthy alternative to self-destructive tendencies that actually work. I don‚Äôt mean the ‚Äúgo on and walk and do a hobby‚Äù type of stuff you see on the internet.

1gk8k1n,I don't take my antipsychotics anymore because they make me worse and I keep asking for refills,MentalHealthSupport,1730818592.0,5,4,"TW: controlled substance (no drug abuse), CSA mentions, and slight psych ward and suicidal thouggr mentions

I have been diagnosed with ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PTSD when I was 17, Major Depressive Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features, Unspecified Bipolar Disorder, and Schizophrenia.



So basically I have had more major mania and psychosis since 2019 when I was 18, on and off. 

In late 2017 or 2018, I posted on social media about the sexual abuse I was experiencing and had experienced since I was 14 at the hands of my mother's boyfriend, at the direction of my mother. I was fed up and wanted the power dynamic gone. My aunt called my mother to tell her what I posted and my mother got really angry with me and told me to delete the post. I saved screenshots and deleted the post. There was so much fallout. CPS showed up at my school the next morning and I was very afraid and couldn't talk about it. I asked to go back to class. My mother told me were going to Costco and then dropped me off at my mother's house. She said I was going to stay there for a while. My grandmother kept accusing me of lying periodically.

I went off my ADHD meds when I was 17 in 2018 because I didn't want my family to control me. I feel like it was a mistake. But I also wanted a choice. I self tapered myself off Adderall way too quickly without doctor's guidance. I was in so much pain. I was tapering while my grandmother took me and my cousin on a cruise. My grandmother got angry at me because I didn't know what I wanted at the tourist shops in Mexico. I told her I would know it when I see it. She then accused me of not being on my meds. I was upset and slightly angry. I went and flushed the whole bottle of pills and kept the cut up Adderall that I chopped up very badly with a knife into smaller pieces in my bag and didn't have a pill splitter then. I didn't keep taking them. My grandmother told me I couldn't live with her if I don't take my meds. I was upset that all my family thought of me was if I took my meds or not. 

In 2016, I was sexually assaulted again after looking for my iPod because my mother took it away. I already wasn't coping with the first sexual assault the year prior. I compartmentalized later and I didn't know that happened that day. I spiraled into kicking holes in the wall and created massive holes. I didn't know how to cope with the fact that I had just been sexually assaulted again. My uncle came over shortly after my mother and he boyfriend had left. My uncle told me, ""I don't give a fuck about the walls. If you don't take your meds every day, I'm going to take you to a home for boys that abuse their parents."" My mother lied to him. My mother and her boyfriend later came home. They all acted like I was the problem. My memories were compartmentalized and I didn't know I was sexually assaulted hours earlier.

In December 2017, a couple weeks before my 17th birthday, I decided to go off my meds secretly. I proceeded to have really bad withdrawals that month, even though I only took my meds as prescribed, once a day. I was in so much pain. I was getting somewhat manic and psychotic. I kept blacking out. I live streamed a lot. People were concerned that I would pass out for hours randomly. I had a seizure once that month.

In 2019, I went into a massive manic episode and had some psychosis. In 2021, I got delusions and paranoia while being manic, which the psychosis was from my trauma. Paul Nimz was a skilled nursing facility executive director and I reported him for sexually assaultinf my to the Washington State Department of Health.

In 2022, I was hospitalized for a second time and they put me on lithium, but not for bipolar disorder. It was for my suicidal thoughts and depression. I had been on a few antipsychotics for a few months.

My psychiatrist diagnosed me with unspecified bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in 2023. He later added a second antipsychotic.

I went off my antipsychotics a few months ago and have come to the conclusion that they make my psychosis worse and that antipsychotics make my psychosis worse. I think my psychosis is paired with my hypomania more and usually only happens without mania when I'm sleep deprived. But I don't get psychosis every time I have hypomania. I have come to the the antipsychotics were causing my brain fog since early 2023 and I raely get brain fog now. I later learned that antipsychotics work by reducing dopamine, and that's not good for as I already have a dopamine deficiency because have ADHD. It was taking away the little dopamine I had. I have had very few hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia since going off my antipsychotics.

I worked really hard to get where I am now and my psychiatrist finally put me back on Adderall after being off it for over 6 years. What is true is that my psychosis is no longer a major issue and that no longer is mania/hypomania. But I told him I still take the antipsychotics. I still take the lithium and my antidepressants. 

My question now is how do I feel him I don't take the antipsychotics anymore because they make me worse without him taking me off my Adderall, which I really need because I struggle to function without it. I always take my Adderall as prescribed? The only times I don't take it as prescribed is when I choose not to take it one day or I forget to take it.

I'm also starting to think I don't actually have schizophrenia and that I only get some psychosis during mania/hypomania and only slight, short-lived hallucinations when I'm somewhat sleep deprived.

I just really don't know how to navigate all of this. I see people say it's dangerous for a schizophrenic person to not take their antipsychotics and that it could lead to brain damage and that they wouldn't function. I have lost jobs due to my brain fog and the antipsychotics make it harder to function. How do I explain I don't think I have schizophrenia?",substance abuse

""Accha here's the short version- 2022 te I went through an episode of psychosis. Amr interests are literature, philosophy ar poetry. I read and think a lot and don't talk much. I religiously read Franz Kafka.

Here's some insight about me as a person first- I believe speech is simply a tool to manipulate others perceptions of you and it is very easy to control how society views you if you know how to use that tool correctly. Ekhon kotha hoilo a knife is a tool that is very useful in everyday life just like language but it can also be a weapon if you choose to use it that way. So I don't talk much and pretty much always talk in metaphors. I control information. When I open my mouth I think about what information should I plant in this person so it may benefit me with getting what I want or making things happen they way I want it to.

Now comes the short version of my situation- I got insulted in public at a family event and My cousins who always liked to introduce themselves as my blood related siblings did not stand up for me. Not only that, I was then treated with absolute silence and ignorance when I tried a direct confrontation. I asked multiple times for a ""family shalishi/intervention"" but that did not happen karon apparently everyone was ""worried"" about me. My words were quickly dismissed.

What they don't know about me is that I have NEVER in my life shyed away from a confrontation despite the fact that I am EXTREAMLY introverted and have always had anxiety. But the kind of side eyes I was given and the fact that NOBODY stood up for me including my own father was simply the last straw. I knew then and there I had no friends in this family. Zero. So I decided to hurt them. Something that them and their children and their grand children will never forget and I will make sure everyone who has even remotely heard of me knows it and affected by it.

So I started smoking a lot of pot/marijuana with doors open, I used my pen holder as an ashtray. Evidence blatantly lying everywhere. I only talked in metaphors. I posted on my facebook that I got in Harvard University, said a bunch of weird fucking stuff to a lot of people(I always liked confusing others its entertaining)

For example- I said ""Dad examine my eyes. I wanto to know what I'm seeing is real or not"". Told my friends I can see through walls and everything, when I look down I see Hell and when I look up, I see Heaven. Nothing exists in-between. So my dad I don't know on whose advice took to to an eye hospital. Doctor showed me small letters and asked me if I can see them or not. Then he declared my eyes were fine I don't need glasses. I asked him to scan my brain as well but didn't do it bc he doesn't exactly have any money. I decided to put him on the spot..

Anyway, ultimately I was admitted to a substance abuse related mental institute called Niramoy, Babor Road. The psychology expert doctor there was not even present during my admission, first time he called for me was after 7 straight days of medication and he did not ask anything about me or give me more than 5-7 minutes of talking time. The very first time this guy saw me he asked me why I hated Rabindronath Tagore and tried to strike up an intellectual debate. like that's of any concern to me. Imagine the things going through my head and he want to argue on why I believe a translation work should not deserve a noble prize- with a week long medically silenced brain dead zombie. He dismissed anything I said and very professionally prescribed the correct medicine.

I wonder if he feels a sense of superiority doing that. No, I know he does. I understand why. It's called the ""suffering from success disease"".

Anyway, I was not even told I was being admitted there or for how long I may be there for when I left home in a car. Even criminals who go to jail gets to know how many months or years they have to spend there. I was even more pissed about this. I resolved to get out of there as fast as possible and see my plan through to the end. And I know for a fact I can do it. I have MULTIPLE excuses now and they're pretty damn good ones.

Finally I do not exactly know je amar diagnosis ki karon nobody really told me clearly even to this date. I had to find that out myself by searching the names of the medicines he was prescribing me. The medicine basically made me slurr and I was incapable of formulating speech or writing.

This continued for a solid year and a half even after I got out of there. here's what I ""supposedly"" have according to medicine descriptions on google-

Phychosis  
OCD  
Chronic depression  
Adhd  
Bipolar  
Schizophrenia  
Perkinsons  
Anxeity  
Nymphomania  
Anorexia  
Schizoeffective disorder  
Phobia  
Neurodevelopment disorder  
Paranoia  
Substance related disorder

The medicine list is at least 3 times longer than this but I do not want to defame a doctors name in the field by speaking more. He is as good in his profession as clueless he is about me. Most things he knows about me comes from my family's word so you know how that works. I tried getting personality disorder in that list too. told a friend on discord that my first name is one person and last name is a different person. Tried to imply we are two different people living in one body. But nobody tried giving any therapy for that. Nobody even mentioned it including my doctor. I understand why. They got scared or they saw business. but it had the effect I wanted. it made everyone extremely cautious about trying not to make me angry so they had to watch out what they say in a conversation.

1fprw08,How can I convince my partner to go to therapy?,MentalHealthSupport,1727341794.0,5,1,"How can I convince my partner to go to therapy?

F29 with partner M35 of 4 and a half years. 

He has to go to therapy. He had an abusive childhood, was raised primarily by an alcoholic, has substance abuse issues (which granted, he has some control over currently), left his job in a shitty, traumatic, life-changing way a few years ago which he clearly hasn't fully gotten over, and definitely has anger issues. Oh, and we only fuck when he's hungover which is actually not all that often anymore. I feel like his friend, not his romantic partner. It's awful because he's such a kind hearted soul at the base of it all, and he honestly does try his best to be a great partner to me which is more than I can say for a lot of men. 

Except he won't go to therapy. I've begged him. I'm sick of begging him. I'm sick of asking him. I'm sick of talking about it and I'm sick of the attitude I receive back, I'm sick of the excuses, I'm sick of waiting. Honestly, I'm starting to resent him. I don't really look forward to our future together anymore. I'm bored. I don't want to break up but it kind of feels like I'm going to have to. His biggest excuse is ""I will but not now"" and I'm sorry but I just feel like I'm having the piss taken out of me.

How can I approach this conversation without it being an argument again? How can I ask this question and voice my concerns for the 1000th time whilst I fully expect for nothing to change? I need help and I don't know who else to ask ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",substance abuse

1fi7m3o,Requesting Advice for Recovering from Extreme Mental Issues,MentalHealthSupport,1726500731.0,2,1,"Hey guys, I need advice. For the past 2-3 years I‚Äôve been dealing with extreme mental health issues, depression, paranoia, delusions, anxiety, addiction‚Ä¶ the list goes on. I‚Äôm constantly delusional, believing that everyone around me can basically read my mind and that I‚Äôm being watched and listened to 24/7 (I even believe people can see and hear my dreams when I‚Äôm asleep!). I believe that when I say or do something, I constantly have to fear the opinions of others the next time I see someone, since they were either told, or heard themselves what I had said, done, or even thought. As you can imagine, this is an incredibly unhealthy mindset to have. I can‚Äôt really begin to explain how this started, but it stemmed from the fact I was a toxic and emotionally/psychologically abusive person in recent years, and that being observed 24/7 is some for of retribution or therapy for that. An example of a constant, consistent delusion of mine is that every time I say or do something, everyone in the world has the ability to respond to that in some way, whether it be agreeing, disagreeing, judging, or giving their opinion on said thought or action. I believe people are triggering me on purpose: eg. someone clearing their throat or blowing their nose just to annoy me. The premise being the thought that people would do this on purpose just to get at me can have an incredibly triggering and gaslighting effect when done by a random person in a random situation. Another example is someone doing something in time to a line said by another person or from a video I‚Äôm watching eg. (Someone says in a video: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a horrible person,‚Äù and someone then clears their throat to confirm it.) I have a number of beliefs on the purpose of this: that there are people who are trying to help me by having me try and ignore these delusions in order to interact and speak with the people around me to dissolve the untrue from the true and teach me extreme emotional regulation; that there are people who want me to know they don‚Äôt like me and are trying to fuck with me or punish me based on the abuse I‚Äôve given to others in the past (I essentially believe some entity has given the entire world the power to psychologically abuse me); or that there are those who are trying to help me get through these delusions through positive thinking by ignoring said delusions. I also believe there are a small number of people who actually understand what I‚Äôm going through and are simply giving me the space I need, and those are the actions and opinions that I rarely see. I literally believe that when someone posts something to their Instagram story or their Facebook page or even something like a news article, that it is about me or is directed towards me (for example: ‚ÄúMan Has Violent Outburst Today‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fuck with this guy.‚Äù I constantly think people are talking about me wherever I go and that the whole world knows who I am, since someone as delusional and mentally ill as me would be something to talk about and react to.

Now you can imagine where the addiction comes from. Instead of seeking professional help (because truly, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anyone who can completely heal what I‚Äôm going through) I self-medicated and turned to alcohol, weed, and nicotine to help me. Of course, it ended up making it worse. Admittedly, a huge part of me still blames the people around me for my drinking and smoking habits, because, in order to listen and watch me 24/7 as I believe everyone has the ability to do, there must have been and continues to be a huge breach of personal rights. 

The culmination of all of this happened recently with a huge mental breakdown where I essentially believed that the world wanted me to embarrass myself by doing some extremely psychotic things such as have someone beat me up, break my neck, or kill myself in order to pay for the way I treated other people. I ended up losing my car because I believed people wanted me to lose my keys on purpose and was extremely  close to killing or seriously injuring myself, all because I believed the world wanted that to happen. I‚Äôve since been able to change this way of thinking through interacting with people, especially my family. I‚Äôve been in really bad delusional states before, but never this bad.

I‚Äôve been to a psych ward before for things I‚Äôve done in a delusional and manic state (I‚Äôve been diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder) and recently got out of a 30 day stay at a hospital for the most recent mental breakdown. I‚Äôm finally taking my anti-psychotic meds regularly (but honestly, the meds haven‚Äôt helped at all with either my emotional state, or the delusions themselves) and am currently attending a group therapy outpatient program at the same hospital. The group therapy and lessons I‚Äôm learning have helped a lot with dealing with some of these issues (There are a lot of positive things in these classes). I believe I need some kind of intense therapy to truly combat these delusions.

I know I need some kind of treatment. My issue is, I don‚Äôt know at all what that looks like. My dad wants me to go to rehab for my alcoholism, but due to the religious and restrictive nature of the program he wants me in (Teen Challenge) and it‚Äôs inability to treat mental illnesses, I believe it might make me worse off than just living day to day life with the delusions. The program is essentially a drug and alcohol rehab wherein I am isolated from any outside influence save from Christian books and teachings; and am forced to work, fundraise, and only interact with other people in the program. I also have the option to look for and attend other programs. These other rehab programs are all an average of 90 days and are basically facilities used to treat addiction. I think my main issue is, I‚Äôm certain addiction isn‚Äôt the problem here. I‚Äôm not going to go back to drinking and smoking (my brain is foggy as hell and I have memory issues from all the ‚Äúdrug‚Äù use and I don‚Äôt want to make it worse. I also have this belief that since everyone is watching me, it would be a bad influence to ever go back to taking ‚Äúdrugs‚Äù again) so I don‚Äôt think I need rehab. let me also say, believing the entire world wanted me dead really put a kick to the whole substance abuse in general. What I really need is something to help me with these delusions and living everyday life. I just have no idea what that looks like (maybe just therapy?). I have found programs that help with mental health issues that last around 2 weeks and these honestly seem better than rehab, but I‚Äôm not sure how much 2 weeks in a program like that could truly help and heal with what I‚Äôm going through. Still, they seem to be a better option than 90 days of isolation.

What I believe would really help me, is to live at home with my family. I can‚Äôt begin to describe how amazing just talking and being around my family has helped dispel the immense paranoia that I had before. I think the best healing would be to be surrounded by people who love and care about me in a calm and peaceful environment. However, I understand this is a selfish thought. During a delusional state and while drunk and manic, I lashed out and would do extreme things to ‚Äúget back‚Äù at my family who I thought were psychologically abusing me. This included splashing water on them (which led to me fighting my brother), marking up their furniture and walls, and other extreme things which I considered to be at the time‚Äúa silent protest.‚Äù This led to a restraining order placed against me by my father. I have since repaired the relationship with them, however I don‚Äôt believe I have apologized enough for the damage I‚Äôve caused. If I were to return home, I would try and help in any way I could, by repairing and paying for what I‚Äôve destroyed, doing chores, and generally just helping out around the house. They said they are open to me returning home, but I quote: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know when or what that would look like.‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll talk about it.‚Äù I would understand not wanting me back home and being scared of the possibility that I might get worse again. They have also offered to pay for an apartment for me to live in by myself and I believe I could very quickly sustain the cost and eventually pay them back. They keep telling me I don‚Äôt need to, but I know I have to. I‚Äôm currently homeless and they‚Äôre helping me out by paying for a hotel room for me to stay in while we decide what treatment to follow up with. I don‚Äôt want to be a burden any more and with each passing day, I am spending more of their money. They don‚Äôt have money for expensive therapy programs. I‚Äôll essentially have to rely on insurance. The sooner I find a solution the better.

I‚Äôm coming to you guys to ask for help. Do you guys have any advice or wisdom for what I‚Äôm going through? Do you know of any programs or types of therapy that can help with my excessive mental health issues? Do you guys think rehab would help, hinder, or just prolong my issues? Should I look for more mental health programs? Should I just talk with a therapist and psychiatrist? Can anyone else relate to what I‚Äôm going through? What do you guys think the solution is? Is there even a solution?",substance abuse

I have never told anyone because I find the topic to be embarrassing to bring up around family/friends.

Its really not helping my mental health especially on the days I do relapse because I have so much guilt and shame from doing it. I have relapsed too many times to count at this point. 

Its not that I want the ""easy"" way to do quit because I think a lot of quitting porn is mindset but I genuinely feel like I have an addiction that I need help with. I do already have a psychiatrist for anxiety and depression but I have been thinking about going to them for this also. 

Does anyone have any experiences with porn addiction and going to a psychiatrist for it? Can they help and possibly provide medication to help with addictions like this?

1jc4v9r,"How can I support my roommate (tw: self harm, addiction)",MentalHealthSupport,1742071913.0,0,1,"I (27f) have lived with my roommate (28f) for a year now. We grew up together and our families are close, and we reconnected about a year and a half ago as adults. We moved about 4 hours away from our hometown and are living together in a big city. My roommate has had a tough year - although she is excelling at work there is a lot of drama and she isn't using her masters degree in the way she wants, she's struggled with eating and body image, and she's gone on some really awful dates (like truly terrible) and hasn't had the best of luck dating. On her 28th birthday she broke down because she has never been in a relationship.

It's been tough to watch her struggle with her mental health the last year. I try to be supportive by hearing her out, letting her vent, validating her, and trying to build her up. I plan activities I think she'll like so she is getting out and exploring. I've also suggested she try therapy. She's been in therapy before and liked it. I go to therapy weekly and think it is so beneficial and sent her the website where I found my therapist, although she hasn't signed up yet. 

She is also sober due to an addiction in college and I think she's struggled not to relapse. I've had to stop her from driving to the liquor store a few times. She often starts vaping then tries to quit cold turkey which causes really bad panic attacks, one so bad she almost went to the ER. She's struggled with rejection from jobs and men and that can cause a big emotional reaction. 

The weather is starting to warm up and yesterday she was in short sleeves - I noticed she had cuts up her arm. She's struggled with self harm in the past. I think my means of supporting her aren't enough and I was hoping I could get advice on this situation and supporting her better. Should I sit her down and address the cuts and her mental health in general? Do I get her parents involved? She is very close with them and they stepped in during her addiction. I know when she struggles she calls them. 

I am very worried about her and think she probably needs professional help. What can I do?",addiction

I have been trying for over 6 years to quit. I am 21 year old male and have been trying since I was 14.5 years old. It gives me a lot of anxiety, depression, gives me headaches, fatigue, intrusive sexual thoughts, and changes my view in women to be more objectifying even though I dislike it. If you look at my post history you can tell Im a bit fucking nuts, it really affects me in a terrible way. I have been to multiple therapist by the way and am starting to think it is not trauma related as much as it is just a dopaminergic issue.

I will jerk off in my sleep (sexsomnia) if I havent had a release in awhile, get anxiety attacks, and those sexsomnia and sex dreams always cause me to relapse. 

I have tried shrooms, semaglutide, tirzepetadie, naltrexone, NAc, and other things in hopes of helping. The only thing that helps is microdosing psychedelics.

I am now waiting for an ibogaine trip as it is known as an addiction interrupter and helps people in dire scenarios. I am hoping it can help me but it is about 3.75 months away from happening so I have to wait. Then if it doesnt work I dont fucking know man. If I have a sex dream and I dont relapse I just end up having another one and my body just gives out on itself. I dont want to be doped up all the time and have erectile dysfunction and watch that horrid shit when I want to have a loving family instead. These intrusive sexual thoughts that are visual just come up so much that I feel my brain relapses on its own even if I am doing something else.

1hagr0m,"My Struggle with Loneliness and Weed Addiction as a Flight Attendant

",MentalHealthSupport,1733769324.0,0,1,"I‚Äôve always had a passion for travel, and being a flight attendant seemed like the perfect job. I get to explore the world, meet new people, and have the freedom of the skies. But there‚Äôs a side of this job that no one ever talks about: the loneliness.

Being away from home for days at a time, constantly moving between different cities, and spending long hours on planes can be incredibly isolating. Even when I‚Äôm surrounded by people, I often feel completely alone. I‚Äôve made friends along the way, but they come and go, and most of my time is spent in hotel rooms, airports, and unfamiliar places. It‚Äôs hard to explain to others, but that sense of loneliness is overwhelming sometimes.

At first, I thought I could handle it. I told myself that the excitement of travel and the thrill of my job would be enough to keep me happy. But over time, the loneliness started to eat away at me. The days would stretch on, and the weight of being alone in an unfamiliar city would start to feel heavier. I needed something to cope with the emptiness I felt.

That‚Äôs when I turned to marijuana. It started as a way to unwind after long flights or stressful days. A little puff here and there to numb the emotions and ease the stress of being away from home. But what began as something I thought would help quickly turned into an addiction. The relief it gave me felt so good, and it became my way of coping with everything ‚Äî the anxiety, the sadness, the isolation.

I found myself reaching for my vape pen more and more. At first, it was just on my days off, but then it was every night, then every moment I was alone. Even on layovers or between flights, I would find a quiet spot and escape into the haze of the smoke. It became my crutch, my way of dealing with feelings I couldn‚Äôt face head-on. I began to rely on it to calm my nerves and quiet the negative thoughts. It gave me an instant sense of relief, but it didn‚Äôt last long.

The problem is, I know I‚Äôm risking my job. I know that what I‚Äôm doing could jeopardize everything I‚Äôve worked for. I‚Äôve heard the stories of others who‚Äôve lost their jobs due to substance use, and deep down, I know I‚Äôm walking a dangerous line. But in those moments of loneliness, when everything feels too heavy to bear, it seems like the only way to survive. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve become addicted not just to the weed, but to the escape it provides.

I‚Äôve tried to stop, but it‚Äôs harder than I imagined. The pull of the addiction is strong, and it‚Äôs difficult to face the loneliness without something to take the edge off. But I‚Äôm starting to realize that I can‚Äôt keep going down this path. I don‚Äôt want to lose my career, my health, or my future to this addiction. I need to find another way to cope, to confront my feelings and deal with my loneliness in a healthier way.

I‚Äôm sharing this story because I know I‚Äôm not the only one who feels this way. There are others who are struggling in silence, using substances to numb the pain of loneliness and isolation. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. I‚Äôm learning that reaching out for help, talking to others, and finding healthier outlets for my emotions are the first steps in reclaiming my life. It won‚Äôt be easy, but I‚Äôm ready to face my challenges head-on. I‚Äôm ready to let go of the crutch and start living my life with a sense of purpose and clarity.

1ht4e6q,I‚Äôm seeking advice,MentalHealthSupport,1735958528.0,0,1,"To start this off, I am looking for advice regarding my brother (30m).

Some Background:

I broke my ankle and my foot (different sides) a month after graduating college and was in a wheelchair for a month, then on crutches for a few months after that. Due to multiple factors, it made sense for me to move back home while I recover and find a job. Prior to that I had been living roughly 2,000 miles (3,200km) away from home and because of the distance and costs associated with flying home, I would only visit once a year over winter break. Because of this, I have found myself in the middle of this situation. My brother has struggled for most of his life with fitting in and for lack of a better term, being a functioning member of society. He barely made it through high school and never considered going to college. In the 12 years since he graduated from high school, he has had 4 jobs and the longest amount of time he has been able to hold a job was 6 months. Because of this he has been living at my parents‚Äô house for most of the time. The only exception to that was when he left in the middle of the night without telling anyone and drove across the country to live with some of his friends from high school. While he was living there, he became an alcoholic and from what his friends have told me, also used quite a bit of cocaine. Once he got fired and kicked out of his friend‚Äôs house for not being able to pay his portion of the rent and bills, he decided to come back to my parents‚Äô house.

Since I came home in September, it has been rough. My brother has bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. In addition to this, he also is convinced that he can‚Äôt eat unless he is drunk. Unfortunately, his doctor and his therapist have told him that it would be worse to not eat than to drink every day. He has taken some liberties with this conclusion and drinks 15-20 shots of whiskey a night, and gets blackout drunk most nights. Two years ago, he got dangerously drunk on New Year‚Äôs Eve and I had to call an ambulance to come get him. He was checked into a detox/rehab facility but left 2 days later because ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt have any food he could eat‚Äù. I should mention that in addition to believing that he has to be drunk to eat, he will only eat certain foods. I should also mention that he has been to multipole doctors to figure out what is causing his inability to eat and there is nothing physically or mechanically wrong that would prevent him from eating. Despite this, he is convinced that the doctors have no idea what they are talking about and is not open to discussing how his difficulty with eating might be a mental block rather than a physical/mechanical issue.

I find myself afraid to say how I feel because the last time I did that my brother started punching me. What happened was he was upset that dinner was taking longer than expected. I was already annoyed that this was such a big issue because he had asked me to make 4 cheese ravioli from scratch. I have a bad habit of being a people pleaser, so I said yes to this request. I told him that I had never made them before, so I didn‚Äôt know how long it would take. When it took longer than he had hoped, he slammed the door to his room. I got mad and said that there was no need to slam the door and if he helped, it would be done sooner. He claimed that he didn‚Äôt slam the door, which was bs, and I said ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ Bulls\*\*\*‚Äù. At this time the food was done, and I had already made plans to go to my friend‚Äôs house, so I went out to my car and as I was about to drive out of the driveway, he came out of the house and wanted to talk to me about slamming the door. I told him that I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it and was going to my friend‚Äôs house. At that point he started punching my face. I felt so helpless. At this time, I still needed crutches to move around and couldn‚Äôt run from danger if my life depended on it. To make matters worse, I saw his dog come out and I didn‚Äôt know where she was, so I didn‚Äôt want to back out and possibly run over her, so I was trapped. At this point my dad hears me yelling ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt f\*\*\*\*\*\* touch me‚Äù and ‚Äúget away from me‚Äù so he comes out of the house to see my brother assaulting me. As my dad, who has Parkinson‚Äôs, tries to get my brother off of me, my brother starts yelling and threatening my dad so the whole neighborhood could hear, I mean traffic on our road stopped because this was such an event. I ended up staying at my friend‚Äôs house for a few days and my parents convinced me to not press charges. Because of this, I‚Äôm afraid to tell him how I feel or say anything that might upset him. He claims to have no recollection of it and has never apologized and blamed it on BPD.

Recently, he claimed that he heeds 10 drinks to eat and another 10 drinks to ‚Äúdeal with stuff that I need to deal with‚Äù. He won‚Äôt tell anyone what it is, but he has said that he can‚Äôt deal with it until he moves out. A week ago, he was showing me something on his phone and while he was showing it to me a notification showed popped up from a page that had ‚ÄúMTF‚Äù in the title. He took his phone away and walked away without saying anything. My suspicion is that he is trans but doesn‚Äôt want to say anything until he moves out. If that is the case, I‚Äôm not sure why he is keeping is a secret from me. He knows my ex-boyfriend is trans, that some of my best friends are trans, and that I would never judge him or think differently. As far as my parents go, they had met my ex on multiple occasions and other than the random awkward question, were fully accepting and supportive of him and my relationship with him. I understand that if this is the case, it is up to him to let people know only if and when he wants to. I just want to know what I can do to support him while keeping myself safe.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Any advice would be great.

I have been with my girlfriend (both under 18) for a little under a year now, we have been through a lot together and she is suffering. I‚Äôm looking for answers, and we believe she has stockholm syndrome.

She grew up in a very dysfunctional home, her parents were both on drugs and her mother left at a young age, and her relationship with her father was always terrible due to his drinking/drug problem. She lived with her dad and grandma for most of her life but her grandma had custody of her. Eventually she got a roommate and along with him came his uncle (29M) (I will call him X). For the first few months everything was fine until X and my girlfriend started to become closer. For her, he was someone to talk to about all her problems and a shoulder to cry on; something she never had. X would comfort her and eventually, that lead to them doing drugs together. X was a cocaine plug so he had plenty of access to substances; he would teach her how to do the drugs and eventually she got used to them. The relationship became sexual and X trained her using drugs as a reward system. He started to hit her and rape her whenever he wanted but my girlfriend stayed because he was all she had and she had feelings for him. He became more and more unhinged. He would threaten to kill her and her family, pointing his gun at her head frequently. Then, we got together. This whole time she never told me about X. We were good for about 3 months (or so I thought) Well, while I was asleep in her bedroom one night, X came to the house and they were hanging out in the garage where he began to hit her with his gun and call her satan spawn, the devil, etc. Then her father and his friend pulled up. X put away his gun and told her to be quiet and threatened to shoot her. X and her father got into an argument over their roommate, and X shot her father and his friend in front of her. Neither of them survived. He spared my girlfriend and even let her dog back in the gate before leaving. He was apprehended by police soon after. After we were done with questioning by the cops she ended up telling me everything. X was still touching her whenever he had the chance (and wouldn‚Äôt stop) and was still beating her and calling her the devil etc whenever nobody else was present. He had threatened her saying he would kill both me and her if she ever said anything to anyone.

She still has his jacket. And wears it frequently. She says she hates him for everything he put her through but she also loves him. She still wants to go to his pretrials and I support her as best as I can but it also takes a toll on me. She also has CPTSD/PTSD (diagnosed) and frequent nightmares related to the incident her father died almost a year later.

1f160s7,Need advice on a relative showing escalating Paranoid Delusional behaviour,MentalHealthSupport,1724617679.0,0,1,"Hi. I will start my post by saying that I'm based in the UK.

The situation is this. My brother and I live quite far apart, as we're both in our 20s now, but we've maintained a very close bond for years in spite of this, and we call/text every day. For some context, my brother grew up in an extremely abusive household, where he regularly witnessed his alcoholic Father beating his mother, and issue threats to him and his siblings. In his teenage years he fell into selling drugs, and using extreme amounts of Cannabis, with semi-frequent Cocaine abuse then emerging. Whilst involved in this lifestyle, he was frequently involved in altercations with unsavoury people, and had some run-ins with the law but avoided receiving a criminal conviction.

Starting roughly 2 years ago now, shortly after I moved away, he had some extremely traumatic breakups, and relationships with his friends began to deteriorate. 2 of his friends in particular, I had warned him against, as they would frequently encourage him to do increasingly illegal things, but wouldn't participate themselves in these illegal things. 

At the start of his deterioration of relationship with these ""friends"", he would say things like ""I think they've been trying to set me up."". I would dismiss these notions as they didn't make much sense. But before long, this escalated into ""They've been trying to persuade me to commit certain acts so they can have me arrested"". He then adopted a theory that they were informants working for the Police, attempting to have him caught red handed. He had admittedly been in quite a few Police chases, and been arrested a couple of times, but he would mostly manage to evade them, and the arrests never came to any charges.

He has a belief, that his former friends have had a complex conspiracy against him for several years, with the main focus of it being to have him arrested. He then began to feel suspicion against colleagues, friends, family friends and bosses, believing that they were involved in this conspiracy. To the extent where he went for a Kitchen Assistant job in a pub chain, and because members of the chain's Head Office had attended the group induction, came back home saying the whole job was a Police operation. He said that the Kitchen Manager worked for the NCA (National Crime Agency) and were agents sent to collect intelligence on him.

After abandoning that role, he landed a job working for a large utilities company in customer service. In the training they made the whole group do a ""personality quiz"", and he came home saying that this was a surveillance tool being used by the Police to collect evidence on him for the upcoming case that was being brought against him due to the actions of his former friends.

He lives with his mother (who isn't my mother, but we have a close relationship and have discussed this issue at length), who is aware of his theories as he frequently discusses them with her. She is of the same persuasion as me, that they're ridiculous theories, and that he needs to get some help. She is aware of the extent of his paranoia, but not of the recent escalations, which I will describe below.

His most recent employment was ad-hoc work for an events company. Again, came home saying that the boss had something against him, as he had undergone an hours cut. He escalated this into surmising that his boss was also implicated in the conspiracy to have him arrested.

He has now spent the best part of 24 months escalating this thought pattern and self-reinforcing it. He then disclosed to me recently that he was waiting outside the houses of his former friends, as well as the house of a boss of his. I told him that this was ridiculously inappropriate, and have attempted to warn him of potential consequences, as well as hammering home the moral implications of this stalking/harassment behaviour.

He has expressed suicidal thoughts recently, and informed me and his mother that he had even gotten a length of electrical cable ready for hanging himself. This feeling of despair, has escalated to a point where he doesn't care about the implications of his harassing behaviour as ""I'll be in prison soon anyway"" or ""I won't be here soon anyway."". So he has nothing to lose, and is acting outrageously because he feels like he is the victim of a huge conspiracy. His mother is aware of the paranoia and suicidal thoughts, and has told him to contact his GP. He did, and all they did was prescribe some SSRIs, and advise him to call the crisis line if he got any thoughts of harming himself. They took no further support actions. As well as that, he doesn't trust medical professionals, and I've read that Paranoid individuals often attempt to sabotage therapy/treatment, and he does have a habit of downplaying things, so it's hard to know exactly what he said to them.

He is expressing thoughts that he will get revenge against his former friends, colleagues and bosses, and has already escalated his behaviour from fixation, to actually going to people's private residences. Shining torches through their window in the early hours of the morning, leaving glass bottles on their doorsteps etc. He has expressed thoughts about vandalising their cars before, or smashing windows etc, and I feel that the behaviour is now escalating to a point where he is genuinely going to hurt himself or someone else. 

- I have considered contacting the Police, as I'd rather them intervene now than after he's done something and hurt someone, and also gotten himself into criminal liability. But as far as I know he hasn't yet committed a crime, and his disclosures to me have all been over the phone so, I couldn't even prove that he had told me these things for them to investigate. So with the Police route, I don't know what they could actually do.

- I have considered contacting the mental health services to raise a welfare concern, but again, these disclosures are over calls primarily, so I don't have written record of his disclosures. He would most certainly deny these claims if medical professionals did get in contact with him for any reason, as he does not trust them, and doesn't want to discuss his theories with them as ""They're mainstream people. They wouldn't understand. Plus, they have to work with the Police anyway."" So, I can't see reporting him to these services being an effective intervention.

- He doesn't believe that he is paranoid, and is 100% in the belief that his theories are rational, justified and true. He does not accept the concerns of me or his mother, as he just thinks we don't believe him.

--

What on Earth am I meant to do? I feel like if I don't do anything, he's going to hurt someone and get himself in trouble, which as a brother to him, hurts me a lot. Yet, I also don't see any potential here where I can intervene, as he is not wanting any help. I am not fond of self-diagnosing, or diagnosing other people when unqualified, however, he shows all the clinical symptoms of Paranoid Delusional Disorder, which is very treatment resistant. 

Does anyone have any advice, or has perhaps been through something similar?

1esiweq,My SIL found my brother‚Äôs journal where he says he is hearing voices that are telling him to kill people and himself. He owns guns. I‚Äôm scared! ,MentalHealthSupport,1723685865.0,0,1,"My 42f brother 48M started having a mental health crisis after taking kratom be bought online. He was very paranoid, hearing voices, jumped out of a moving car and disappeared for half a day. 

He went to the emergency room where they drug tested him. He came up positive for a host of drugs, some of which being cocaine, marijuana, lsd, opiates, and PCP. My brother has never done drugs in his life. He is very religious. The hospital wrote him off as a drug addict and send him home. They had the kratom tested and lo and behold. It was positive for said drugs. He was only taking kratom for a chronic pain condition with his back because he didn‚Äôt want to take opiates. 

After all this he fell, had a stroke and fractured his skull. He has no health insurance but was seen in emergency and admitted to the hospital for a few days. Then he was sent home. He saw a GP but wouldn‚Äôt tell him about the voices. They put him on seroquel, but he started having Parkinson‚Äôs like movements. That is how he and m y SIL describe it. So they stopped the meds thinking it was a side effect. 

Today I found out that my SIL went through my brothers phone and found a journal he had been keeping. Two weeks ago he wrote that the voices where telling him to go to a specific place, ( I don‚Äôt know where) and kill some people ( I don‚Äôt know who or how many). Then to kill himself. My brother owns at least 3 guns that I know of. One that he keeps in his bed side table! My SIL said she ‚Äúhid‚Äù the guns and that she is going to take them to my mom‚Äôs house tomorrow. 

They have two little girls, one that is special needs. My brother was always such a good loving father, but I‚Äôm terrified that he could hurt them. I tried to talk my SIL in to leaving with the girls. Or at least send the girls else where. She won‚Äôt. She said she made and appointment with his GP for tomorrow and that she will go with him this time. 

My mother and I think we need to call the police and try to have him committed. We told my SIL this and she refuses. When I confronted her about it she actually said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs been doing good. He wrote that stuff like two weeks ago.‚Äù I said ‚Äúhe is not doing good! You don‚Äôt know what he is really thinking. The only insight you have is his journal, which clearly states his is not doing good! He‚Äôs hearing voices telling him to kill people and himself!‚Äù I‚Äôve begged her to take him to emergency for his new physical symptoms but she won‚Äôt do that either. I told her she is risking her and her children‚Äôs lives. Not to mention other people he could hurt. I realize they don‚Äôt have the means to take him to a specialist but I feel like if something isn‚Äôt done soon someone will get hurt. 

We have an older brother who has been severely schizophrenic among other co diagnosis since he was 16. He is now 52. He has been very violent at times so I know how fast these things can go bad. 

I don‚Äôt know what I should do. My mother says if we call the police they won‚Äôt do anything because we don‚Äôt have proof. My SIL has screen shots of the journal. So my mother says she has to be the one. 

I feel like I‚Äôm the only one that can see that the train we are all on is about to crash into a cliff. I keep screaming for someone to help me stop the train, but everyone else on board thinks things are fine!

She will live but shes in the hospital at this time and its not looking great. It's almost identical to my first attempt. Same age (15) same circumstances, same pills. Please see how much this hurts people. You won't be at peace. It'll be nothing. You'll be gone. Nothing at all. As someone who has been disabled and tried 5 times in the most violent ways. It's not worth it. I've almost been on the other side. Your whole family will be broken. They will notice. She was even on the project for teens team today. She was teaching middle schoolers that it's not okay it won't make anything better. Your whole family will feel the pain you did. Everything and more. I know. Please trust me. I never thought I'd make it to this point of my life. I'm 18 almost 19. Just focus on making it out. If you keep telling yourself on a record how bad life seems it will be. Give yourself something to live for. Reach out to your loved ones. There is help.

I'm just at a loss right now. My mom is furious with her and I get it. She screamed at me when I attempted. But I get it. She tried to leave without leaving anything. No note no texts no posts. 

I know not respond with anger though. It's fine to be angry but don't let them see it. 

How do I support and talk to her without encouraging this kind of thing? How can I be there more for her? I don't want her to see this as a good thing, or something that will get her unneeded attention. I probably won't be able to see or talk to her for a few weeks.

I truly appreciate any insight/help, particularly from those who have experience with this- sadly, my good friend and roommate recently overdosed on their medication (lithium for bipolar, I believe). I was out of town but came home as soon as I could. Luckily, they were able to make it to the hospital in time thanks to my other roommate and are now mostly detoxed and going to enter a rehab facility for a week or so.   


I'm wondering how I can best support them when I  see them again and, hopefully, when they are back here at home? (they may end up staying with family after this, I'm not sure). Before this happened, my other roommate had been updating me to let me know that this friend had been quieter lately and sleeping a lot. I know I shouldn't blame myself and while I tried to reach out to them (they weren't responding to texts while I was away), I do feel awful for not helping more and just want to do better in a sensitive and informed way moving forward.

I don't know though. I look back at my life and I'm thankful to have grown. I live in a nice house, been in a relationship for 7 years. I have everything I wanted as a kid. Yet, it's still not enough. I feel lost. I have suicidal thoughts frequently, mainly since my promotion. I work 47+ hours a week and it kills me. Money is not what drives me. I'm hated by most peers for my success or failures, whichever trumps the two. I want to quit and leave it all. I would normally crash out at this point and go on a bender. For whatever reason I'm scared. Worried about letting someone down. I haven't felt these feelings in a very long time and I'm struggling to navigate it.

1jflc9r,2025 has been rough,MentalHealthSupport,1742464660.0,0,2,"Tw for drug use, overdose, abuse, death, probably more

I'm just having rough year and I can't seem to catch a break.  It started with my mental health being garbage due to being harassed at work.  I was being harassed because of being disabled.  I reported it, but she made up lies about me instead and management decided it was hear say.  I ended up applying for medical leave because I was really not okay and the harassment was heavily affecting me and if I didn't take action I was scared of where things were headed.  But I was denied medical leave and I ended up missing work a bunch because I couldn't get myself to go.  I was fired about a month ago.  Right after I was fired, my mom almost died.  She spent awhile in the ICU where it came to light she's been hiding an addiction.  There's another post on my profile that goes more in depth on this if you want more information.  My bio dad is also an addict and relapsed this year.  During this, I tried to confide in my best friend of 14 years who instead unfriended me basically because I confided in her.  There is also a post on my profile that goes in depth on this situation too.  My mom is in rehab now.  I'm still not talking to her.  And I know she's gonna get home and try to act like nothing happened and like we all should move on.  I know I'm making the right choices for myself by staying firm on my boundaries and refusing that this just be sweeped under the rug and forgiven right away, but it's so hard and exhausting.  I'm so tired of having to advocate for myself.  I feel like I'm the only one being reasonable here.  Everyone thinks rehab is the end of it, but the rest of my family doesn't know what it's like to have an addict parent.  This shit stays around and it's something we need to watch for for the rest of our lives.  And I personally will likely never trust her again.  And I kind of blame her for losing my best friend.  I wouldn't have had to confide in her so much if my mom didn't give me so much to need to talk about, not just recently but my entire life.  I know that friendship wasn't real or beneficial but it still hurts.
Now the newest development, my mom's friend that brought her the drugs while she was in the ICU just overdosed.  They are in the ICU now and on life support.  I'm pissed that they brought my mom drugs and enabled her addiction, but I'm also incredibly sad and scared.  This friend means a lot to me.  Despite their struggles with addiction, I always looked up to them as a queer role model.  They helped me so much with queer issues my family didn't understand.  They inspire me to be a safe space for queer kids some day the way they were for me.  Things aren't looking good.  And the idea of them dying feels like a weight on my chest and I can't sleep.  I'm so scared we're gonna get the call that they died.  I keep having panic attacks.  I'm heart broken for their kid and their parents who already lost their other kid to overdose.  I don't know how to cope with everything.  My OCD is also using this to convince me I shouldn't take my meds because maybe I'll get addicted even though they aren't typically addictive.  In the last two months addiction has been the biggest thing on my mind.  It's something I've always feared for myself.  So much so that before any of this even happened, I made the decision that I wouldn't be drinking this year because I don't like how happy it makes me and how sad I feel after.  It's not like I drank often, at most once every 2 months.  But I know I am predisposed because of my parents and I'm not taking chances.  I also never smoked or did anything more than drink on occasion.  But I have nightmares about being an addict.  I looked into the family members of addicts support groups but I likely won't be able to attend one until Monday.  The only positive is that I am starting a new job and it seems like a great fit for me.  But I'm also worried that everything going on in my personal life is gonna affect my work and I'll get fired again.  Like what if I need to take off work within the first 90 days for a funeral?  What if I'm at work and I get that call?  Or I get the call that my mom decided to sign herself out of rehab?  Or maybe something else entirely?  I'm just so overwhelmed with everything and with the loss of my best friend I'm having trouble confiding in anyone else because I'm scared they'll say it's too much and leave me too.",overdose

This, on top of the exams coming up and 3 other classes is too much for me...

We're in lockdown at the moment and we won't be returning to campus at all for the rest of Sem 2 regardless of lockdown or not. I have really bad anxiety, been going through a massive depressive episode where all I do is sleep, go on the computer for a little bit, and then sleep more. I find it extremely hard to focus, whether that's a fault of mine or not. I can't sit and watch lectures. Our school also isn't giving us any sort of assistance with grades for the lockdowns and such because ""we're experienced with online learning now"".

I'm honestly just thinking of withdrawing from this class and focusing on the others, then taking it again instead next year. My biggest worry is that my parents won't take it well, and that it'll affect my chances at changing my major next year (I'm trying to get into either nursing or health psychology) but I suppose a failing grade will only look worse...

1jmjxrt,My friend is depressed and suicidal and is refusing to seek professional help - How do I get through to them? Is it even possible?,MentalHealthSupport,1743246523.0,0,1,"I have had this friend since we were preteens, and at this point I'm so lost on how to talk to them or what to even do to help them I'm close to throwing in the towel. I've started feeling rather resentful towards them which I feel horrible for, but I just have no idea what else to do or what to say to them that might make a difference. So I've come here hoping that maybe someone has some input on this, or that I'm just approaching things from the wrong angle. Really any help at all would be super appreciated - I care for them a lot and I want to help them.

  
For some context: This friend has always been timid and socially awkward, but has gotten worse and worse over time - they can basically not talk to strangers at all. They are morbidly obese and clearly hate their weight, being incredibly self-deprecating about 'how fat they are', but then don't try to do anything to address the issue / come up with excuses on why they can't do the things people suggest they could try. They are like this in most areas of their life, which I understand is probably due to their depression, but it does mean that my main strategy of helping people - offering advice and support - just doesn't work with them.

  
They are very open about the fact that I'm the only friend they have and have essentially changed life plans in order to not move to a different country for their education (as was their original plan) just so they can stay with their only friend more. They are also very openly self-deprecating in their language around me, no matter what I say, and they have self-harmed / attempted suicide a few times before.

  
I hang out with them every week, and I message them semi-regularly to see if they want to play any games or something, but they usually don't reply to said messages. Being physically there for them more often than that would not be possible without me putting other areas of my life on hold, as they live a while away and I'm busy with my own life - plus, and I admit I am very ashamed of this, but I don't think I could handle being their emotional support person every day. My own mental health isn't that great either, and I'm hesitant to add even more strain onto it.

  
They are not currently seeing a therapist and have brushed off the idea when suggested to them. They used to take antidepressants but I believe they stopped a while ago. I have tried offering them we could do things together more (they're usually too busy), we could do exercise together from time to time (saying that I actually need an accountability buddy myself, which is true!), we could go grocery shopping together from time to time to hang out, but none of those things have worked. I'm their friend, I include them in things I do with other friends of mine (though what we can do with them around is limited due to their weight), I have offered advice on how they could try to handle problems they're having, I have offered to study with them when they were struggling in a subject I'm good at. None of this has worked - outside of hanging out with me from time to time, everything else I've tried has been rejected.

  
I'm sorry this got so long. People I've asked about this have told me to just let them be - you can't help them if they don't want to help themselves - but I know that depression is a bitch and they're not in a position to be helping themselves right now. I just hope that there is still something I could do to help them have a positive impact on their lives, as the way things are going right now, they are probably not even going to be able to find a job.

1ia9maj,"I'm so goddamned tired of life. TW: suicide talk, brief self-harming talk",MentalHealthSupport,1737881020.0,6,4,"Diagnoses include chronic insomnia for which I've been eating meds since 2009. Long-term, severe generalized anxiety. After I saw the hearse outside my best friend's door and knew he'd killed himself(in 2019) I developed an extreme sensitivity to situational stress that plagues me to this day. Also BPD and Depressive PD diagnosed as co-morbid, which makes everything oh so jolly and life in general just such a breeze.

Due to said diagnoses and some really nullifying experiences: Never had a long-term job, never had a long-term GF as a M(37). Mostly because I always felt 'outside,' invisible, an alien trying to figure out how in the hell did everyone else start pairing up in their teens/late teens.

How is it possible to land or hold a job when I literally think of dying or suicide sometimes even before I shamble into the bathroom in the morning. Today I noticed I was thinking of it only after I realized the thought ""What should my last messages be"" popped into my head. I've been thinking of self-harming with a branding iron again. The searing pain is one of the few things that takes me out of where I have been rotting for so long.

I can't approach any woman anymore, as it would require me to be dishonest about my past and current struggles not to mention my diagnoses. I've already tried enough times and been burned or ghosted right off the top at the merest whiff of my issues, no matter how gingerly I try to start shedding light on them. Always after being asked about something related when it comes to new people, I don't overshare in that sense. I constantly feel like I am less than the shit I scrape from my bootheel. The last semblance of a hobby, singing(, I used to be quite adept) I try to keep up with feels like just going through the motions and I only sing 1-3 songs anymore when I do. The vocal warm-ups take longer than the singing itself, literally.

I am in a treatment program, I am medicated, I am in a peer support group. The intensive program and peer group stop around mid-March though, and I am terrified I'll just slip into my own pattern of cutting and numbing myself with extraneous substances then.  The healthcare here is shambolic and imbalanced at best, so I can't trust any healthcare provider's promise of ""You won't be left alone with your problems"" anymore. I have been pushed aside and made to feel invisible by them too, many, many times.

Why can't I just make myself an inch-thick tie... I am so tired. I'm tired of living just so my parents and the few friends I have wouldn't feel bad. I live in mental destitution and time has become a prison. Just so others wouldn't feel bad. What about me.. Why do I have to feel bad? Why do I have to feel like I am unworthy of intimacy and love? Why can't I stop so I wouldn't constantly feel less than everything. I want it to stop.",suicide

1j782rr,"How to tell your parents you‚Äôre feeling suicidal, without overwhelming them",MentalHealthSupport,1741528356.0,1,1,"Hello friends, so I‚Äôm a (23M) and I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety and depression for the past 8-10 years. I‚Äôve had active suicidal thoughts at times the past 5 years. 

The closest I ever came to following through with these thoughts by overdosing was in my 3rd year of university about 3-4 years ago. I remember being my bedroom of the rented room I got for school and I was sitting in my chair having a mental breakdown from being overwhelmed by a new environment (This was my 3rd year at school, but my 2nd year was all online because of Covid 19, so I was at home). I remember my anxiety was so bad that I wouldn‚Äôt want to go upstairs to make food in our houses shared kitchen since I was socially anxious about interacting with the 3 other guys that lived upstairs. So I was almost starving myself at times (They were all great guys btw, my anxiety was just really really bad), was also really worried about finding my classes and not being late (Like every other student), also had multiple assignments that I just felt super overwhelmed with, wasn‚Äôt getting hardly any sleep either. I remember being up until 3-4am most nights just sitting in bed staring into nothing and having rapid thoughts going through my mind about all kinds of things. Majority of them about how I am a failure, I won‚Äôt be able to do the normal tasks that people can do, you know those negative kind of thoughts.

So I remember that day I cameback from class after worrying all night about missing the bus and not finding my classes. I just sat down in my chair and just broke down. I just couldn‚Äôt control it at all, felt my body just getting very achy, started to get a pounding headache, was almost hyperventilating it seemed and I went into my closet and grabbed a bottle of Advil. I just waved it around for a bit and just thought how easy it would be to just not have to deal with any of it. I remember I opened the bottle and grabbed a pill out and just was almost idolized it. I just didn‚Äôt want to deal with any of
It anymore and in that moment I remember the usual thoughts of ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it, you will hurt the people around you, they will suffer long after you‚Äôre gone‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do that to your family & friends‚Äù. Which were the usual thoughts I would have when my suicidal thoughts got really bad, since I don‚Äôt want to hurt the people around me and I truly believe that‚Äôs always been the reason I never went through with any of my suicidal intentions. Because if I didn‚Äôt have great people in my life that cared about me, I would have been gone years ago. Like I have heard stories about people not going through with it, because they are afraid of death & what comes after. But for me I was not afraid of that, I just wanted to be free. So while all that is going on, that sameday I just happened to have a scheduled appointment call with my schools therapist and I also think that call saved my life since it was just nice in that moment to have someone to talk with and I remember telling her I was holding that bottle of Advil and all thoughts I was having. She was amazing, she listened to everything I was trying to say at the time and just convinced me all these feelings will pass (And they did). 

So that was my closest suicidal moment, since then I‚Äôve had similar moments at times in my life (But not to that point again) and I‚Äôm in a similar suicidal thoughts period right now it seems. Over the past week I‚Äôve had 2 breakdowns, 1 passed pretty quickly and wasn‚Äôt too bad to deal with. The other I remember being in the bathroom getting ready for a shower and it just hit me, all the thoughts of not being able to find a job in Canada in the field I studied for or get any kind of job for that matter, was going to get a haircut that day with a friend as well and I was anxious about that, not being able to find my partner in crime throughout all my 23 years on this planet, thoughts of going back to school for another program, thoughts of my parents thinking I‚Äôm a failure and me thinking I am letting them down by not moving forward with my life. While the people I grew up with have been moving forward. I just remember having those same physical symptoms that I had before when I was the closest to taking my life and this episode lasted about 15-25min. I remember trying to ground myself by sitting on the floor or trying any of the techniques I‚Äôve learned over the years and nothing worked. But I just let time do its thing and I was okay after those 15-25min once I got it all out of my system. 

My parents have started to notice since I‚Äôm just acting different I guess (Not in a bad way to them) but I‚Äôm just being more to myself and lying in bed more often.

All this to say, I told my mom I would tell her what‚Äôs going on when she gets back from her trip, since she came into my room before she left saying I could tell her anything and she wouldn‚Äôt be upset with me. I just have no idea how to go about telling my parents something this big without scaring them and I don‚Äôt want to do that. Since everyone in my life has always seen me as a happy & always smiling individual. Like I know suicidal thoughts is a very big deal, but again like I‚Äôm sure a lot of others are that deal with this stuff. You don‚Äôt want to become a burden to those you share these mental health struggles with.

Would love to know others experiences with telling their parents or loved ones about these heavy topics and how they went about it. Thanks in advance for all the advice and thanks for reading, hope you have a fantastic day!",suicide

So I've come here hoping that maybe someone has some input on this, or that I'm just approaching things from the wrong angle. Really any help at all would be super appreciated - I care for them a lot and I want to help them.

  
For some context: This friend has always been timid and socially awkward, but has gotten worse and worse over time - they can basically not talk to strangers at all. They are morbidly obese and clearly hate their weight, being incredibly self-deprecating about 'how fat they are', but then don't try to do anything to address the issue / come up with excuses on why they can't do the things people suggest they could try. They are like this in most areas of their life, which I understand is probably due to their depression, but it does mean that my main strategy of helping people - offering advice and support - just doesn't work with them.

  
They are very open about the fact that I'm the only friend they have and have essentially changed life plans in order to not move to a different country for their education (as was their original plan) just so they can stay with their only friend more. They are also very openly self-deprecating in their language around me, no matter what I say, and they have self-harmed / attempted suicide a few times before.

  
I hang out with them every week, and I message them semi-regularly to see if they want to play any games or something, but they usually don't reply to said messages. Being physically there for them more often than that would not be possible without me putting other areas of my life on hold, as they live a while away and I'm busy with my own life - plus, and I admit I am very ashamed of this, but I don't think I could handle being their emotional support person every day. My own mental health isn't that great either, and I'm hesitant to add even more strain onto it.

  
They are not currently seeing a therapist and have brushed off the idea when suggested to them. They used to take antidepressants but I believe they stopped a while ago. I have tried offering them we could do things together more (they're usually too busy), we could do exercise together from time to time (saying that I actually need an accountability buddy myself, which is true!), we could go grocery shopping together from time to time to hang out, but none of those things have worked. I'm their friend, I include them in things I do with other friends of mine (though what we can do with them around is limited due to their weight), I have offered advice on how they could try to handle problems they're having, I have offered to study with them when they were struggling in a subject I'm good at. None of this has worked - outside of hanging out with me from time to time, everything else I've tried has been rejected.

  
I'm sorry this got so long. People I've asked about this have told me to just let them be - you can't help them if they don't want to help themselves - but I know that depression is a bitch and they're not in a position to be helping themselves right now. I just hope that there is still something I could do to help them have a positive impact on their lives, as the way things are going right now, they are probably not even going to be able to find a job.

1ia9maj,"I'm so goddamned tired of life. TW: suicide talk, brief self-harming talk",MentalHealthSupport,1737881020.0,6,4,"Diagnoses include chronic insomnia for which I've been eating meds since 2009. Long-term, severe generalized anxiety. After I saw the hearse outside my best friend's door and knew he'd killed himself(in 2019) I developed an extreme sensitivity to situational stress that plagues me to this day. Also BPD and Depressive PD diagnosed as co-morbid, which makes everything oh so jolly and life in general just such a breeze.

Due to said diagnoses and some really nullifying experiences: Never had a long-term job, never had a long-term GF as a M(37). Mostly because I always felt 'outside,' invisible, an alien trying to figure out how in the hell did everyone else start pairing up in their teens/late teens.

How is it possible to land or hold a job when I literally think of dying or suicide sometimes even before I shamble into the bathroom in the morning. Today I noticed I was thinking of it only after I realized the thought ""What should my last messages be"" popped into my head. I've been thinking of self-harming with a branding iron again. The searing pain is one of the few things that takes me out of where I have been rotting for so long.

I can't approach any woman anymore, as it would require me to be dishonest about my past and current struggles not to mention my diagnoses. I've already tried enough times and been burned or ghosted right off the top at the merest whiff of my issues, no matter how gingerly I try to start shedding light on them. Always after being asked about something related when it comes to new people, I don't overshare in that sense. I constantly feel like I am less than the shit I scrape from my bootheel. The last semblance of a hobby, singing(, I used to be quite adept) I try to keep up with feels like just going through the motions and I only sing 1-3 songs anymore when I do. The vocal warm-ups take longer than the singing itself, literally.

I am in a treatment program, I am medicated, I am in a peer support group. The intensive program and peer group stop around mid-March though, and I am terrified I'll just slip into my own pattern of cutting and numbing myself with extraneous substances then.  The healthcare here is shambolic and imbalanced at best, so I can't trust any healthcare provider's promise of ""You won't be left alone with your problems"" anymore. I have been pushed aside and made to feel invisible by them too, many, many times.

Why can't I just make myself an inch-thick tie... I am so tired. I'm tired of living just so my parents and the few friends I have wouldn't feel bad. I live in mental destitution and time has become a prison. Just so others wouldn't feel bad. What about me.. Why do I have to feel bad? Why do I have to feel like I am unworthy of intimacy and love? Why can't I stop so I wouldn't constantly feel less than everything. I want it to stop.",suicidal

1j782rr,"How to tell your parents you‚Äôre feeling suicidal, without overwhelming them",MentalHealthSupport,1741528356.0,1,1,"Hello friends, so I‚Äôm a (23M) and I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety and depression for the past 8-10 years. I‚Äôve had active suicidal thoughts at times the past 5 years. 

The closest I ever came to following through with these thoughts by overdosing was in my 3rd year of university about 3-4 years ago. I remember being my bedroom of the rented room I got for school and I was sitting in my chair having a mental breakdown from being overwhelmed by a new environment (This was my 3rd year at school, but my 2nd year was all online because of Covid 19, so I was at home). I remember my anxiety was so bad that I wouldn‚Äôt want to go upstairs to make food in our houses shared kitchen since I was socially anxious about interacting with the 3 other guys that lived upstairs. So I was almost starving myself at times (They were all great guys btw, my anxiety was just really really bad), was also really worried about finding my classes and not being late (Like every other student), also had multiple assignments that I just felt super overwhelmed with, wasn‚Äôt getting hardly any sleep either. I remember being up until 3-4am most nights just sitting in bed staring into nothing and having rapid thoughts going through my mind about all kinds of things. Majority of them about how I am a failure, I won‚Äôt be able to do the normal tasks that people can do, you know those negative kind of thoughts.

So I remember that day I cameback from class after worrying all night about missing the bus and not finding my classes. I just sat down in my chair and just broke down. I just couldn‚Äôt control it at all, felt my body just getting very achy, started to get a pounding headache, was almost hyperventilating it seemed and I went into my closet and grabbed a bottle of Advil. I just waved it around for a bit and just thought how easy it would be to just not have to deal with any of it. I remember I opened the bottle and grabbed a pill out and just was almost idolized it. I just didn‚Äôt want to deal with any of
It anymore and in that moment I remember the usual thoughts of ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it, you will hurt the people around you, they will suffer long after you‚Äôre gone‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do that to your family & friends‚Äù. Which were the usual thoughts I would have when my suicidal thoughts got really bad, since I don‚Äôt want to hurt the people around me and I truly believe that‚Äôs always been the reason I never went through with any of my suicidal intentions. Because if I didn‚Äôt have great people in my life that cared about me, I would have been gone years ago. Like I have heard stories about people not going through with it, because they are afraid of death & what comes after. But for me I was not afraid of that, I just wanted to be free. So while all that is going on, that sameday I just happened to have a scheduled appointment call with my schools therapist and I also think that call saved my life since it was just nice in that moment to have someone to talk with and I remember telling her I was holding that bottle of Advil and all thoughts I was having. She was amazing, she listened to everything I was trying to say at the time and just convinced me all these feelings will pass (And they did). 

So that was my closest suicidal moment, since then I‚Äôve had similar moments at times in my life (But not to that point again) and I‚Äôm in a similar suicidal thoughts period right now it seems. Over the past week I‚Äôve had 2 breakdowns, 1 passed pretty quickly and wasn‚Äôt too bad to deal with. The other I remember being in the bathroom getting ready for a shower and it just hit me, all the thoughts of not being able to find a job in Canada in the field I studied for or get any kind of job for that matter, was going to get a haircut that day with a friend as well and I was anxious about that, not being able to find my partner in crime throughout all my 23 years on this planet, thoughts of going back to school for another program, thoughts of my parents thinking I‚Äôm a failure and me thinking I am letting them down by not moving forward with my life. While the people I grew up with have been moving forward. I just remember having those same physical symptoms that I had before when I was the closest to taking my life and this episode lasted about 15-25min. I remember trying to ground myself by sitting on the floor or trying any of the techniques I‚Äôve learned over the years and nothing worked. But I just let time do its thing and I was okay after those 15-25min once I got it all out of my system. 

My parents have started to notice since I‚Äôm just acting different I guess (Not in a bad way to them) but I‚Äôm just being more to myself and lying in bed more often.

All this to say, I told my mom I would tell her what‚Äôs going on when she gets back from her trip, since she came into my room before she left saying I could tell her anything and she wouldn‚Äôt be upset with me. I just have no idea how to go about telling my parents something this big without scaring them and I don‚Äôt want to do that. Since everyone in my life has always seen me as a happy & always smiling individual. Like I know suicidal thoughts is a very big deal, but again like I‚Äôm sure a lot of others are that deal with this stuff. You don‚Äôt want to become a burden to those you share these mental health struggles with.

Would love to know others experiences with telling their parents or loved ones about these heavy topics and how they went about it. Thanks in advance for all the advice and thanks for reading, hope you have a fantastic day!",suicidal

Since I was a little girl I hated myself, my whole life I‚Äôve been suffering from abuse at home , being called ugly at school being bullied, at 10 yo I stopped eating started self harming ,and started developing depression. At 12 years old I got hospitalized, I was bullied at the freaking mental hospital, girls called me ugly , burned my hair , spread lies, I am a very introverted girl, I barely talk , I always like to be alone I never talk back. Maybe that‚Äôs why, 
I tried to end it all twice and failed, the abuse at home continued at this point I was hospitalized two years, then , they kicked me out. 
I was at home , alone abused and suffering, tried to end it all again, and then got back to a different mental hospital and started ECT treatment. I completely lost myself and then the worst thing that ever happened to me happened. While I was at ‚Äúday care‚Äù in the hospital I got raped by a guy repeatedly, for 6 months, I started sniffing clonex and consuming alcohol daily to deal with the pain I‚Äôve been through the last time it happened I was in a risk of pregnancy, and they kicked me out .

1imt8x1,I keep thinking of ending my life and I really need to vent,MentalHealthSupport,1739258970.0,1,1,"I keep thinking about it for the past 2 days. I'd been suffering from depression for a little over a year at this point, and suicidal thoughts have appeared and disappeared before, but the thoughts that came to me these past 2 days were so intense.

On Sunday when it first came back, I tried talking to a family member who I've talked about this topic before, but they seems to be really upset by it. When I realized that, I stopped talking, cried alone and later came to check on them and say sorry because I didn't know they felt upset with that topic.

The thoughts were triggered by a reminder of the traumatic events in my teen which involves a lot of suicidal thoughts, and was when no one was around to help me. Lately, I had some disagreement with my parents, and they implied that they'd stop funding my college if a goal is not met, which means I would have to go back to their house, where the traumatic events happened years ago. Instead of coming up with normal problem solving solutions that might works, after 2 whys, my brain could just jump straight to ""suicide is an option"". My thought process still goes to that conclusion even when I tries to rethink about it a few more times. Usually I can dismiss it as an intrusive thought, but it's not something I can just dismiss anymore. I freaked out when I realized part of me is actually considering it. I'm scared because I am highly stressed right now, and when even just part of my consider suicide, all it might take is a crisis for me to actually do it. It scares me so badly but I can't stop it.

I also find that I'm unable to recall good memories to distract myself from horrible thoughts sometimes. It's like: I know this thing did happen, and I remember it as being one of the most fun thing in a long time, but I just cannot recall the good feeling from it. I feel nothing when I try to think about it, then follow by upset that I can no longer recall it.

Monday when I came back to college, I went straight to student therapy service and asked them to book a session for me, I couldn't help crying as soon as I reached the door, and ended up keep on thinking about it even after I was done informing them. I later bumped into a group of friend whom I'm not close with and have never discussed this with. They were having lunch and were gonna head to a lecture. I didn't want to explain myself but is also too polite to say no so I sat down with them with headphone on noise cancelling while everyone talked to one another, while I tried the whole time not to cry. I still cried, they probably saw it too but just left me with it. I just feel embarrassed and even sadder that I'm surrounded by friends but not anyone I could just bring up suicide to, since it is a taboo topic, as much as it shouldn't be, it's just the reality.

It is something that weights me down heavily and I need to get off my chest, even with no one irl to for me tell to yet, since I cannot get therapy right away.",end my life

I need to go to the psych ward. I have no other options and no other things that I can try that might help me. This is the last resort, and I fear that I might go through with my plan soon. But I am absolutely terrified of the consequences of going to a facility. I am a minor under the care of my parents, which means I don't have control over my life yet. Both of my parents are abusive and manipulative in different ways, and I know both of them will be horrible towards me if I go to the psych ward. They will mentally and verbally abuse me non-stop while I am there and likely for the rest of my life. While I can't know this for certain, I know my parents, and I know their tendency towards subtle evils that make my life so much harder. Not to mention, I live in the U.S, so it will probably be expensive as fuck. 

I have been in therapy for 2 years, and on anti-depressants for even longer. I have a good support system, I have people who care about me, I have most of the things that people say will help with suicidal thoughts. Nothing helps, and I've only been getting worse. I am fully aware that it takes time and patience to get better, and that I still have a full life left to live and all that shit and I KNOW that I'm ""solving a temporary problem with a permanent solution"". That changes nothing. This is how I feel, I am desperate to kill myself and my health is not going to improve fast enough to change that in the near future. 

I don't really know where I'm going with this post, I just want to die but I need to live. I think I need the psych ward but I can't bring myself to go out of fear of my parents. I don't know, I don't know anything. I'm just tired. I'm on my last straw. ",end my life

So here it is, if it's no too damn long so someone read it

Hi Reddit.

I'm posting this because a friend recommended it to me. I feel empty, angry, sad, and lonely. But I'm now I'm not alone. I just need to speak, write about what I'm feeling. I need to connect with people and talk to someone who know what I'm currently feeling.

First of all, I'm getting professional help. I see a psychologist and a psychiatrist. For now, I just have anxiety meds, not anti depressor, and I'll see with my doctor next month how October was to see if we start AD or not (I think I might need it).

It's a long story. And I want to list the trigger warnings first, because there's a lot : depression, SA, suicide, toxic relationship, domestic violence, manipulation, sexual harassment, moral harassment, toxic friendship, autism, mental health issues and content warning child and animal abuse.

I'm also not a native English speaker, I'm French, so sorry if I make some grammatical mistakes. I hope you'll be able to understand me. Writing in English, even though I'm not quite fluent, helps me take distance with what I'm writing.

So I'm 28, and next month, I'll turn 29. I knew my life has been hard, and that I'm struggling with so mental health issues, I've made a promise to myself (starting as a joke) that, my 10's and 20's were shitty, but my 30's will be good. So I hade until my last 29yo day to get my life together.

So, July the 27th of this year (2024), my last toxic relationship ended. It was my best friend from high school. And to summarize, because I have so much to tell about it, it will be so long, this person (let's call her B) managed to get me drop off my thesis, move next to her, take care of her kids, cleaned her house, live for her, slept (not sex, actuel sleep) with her because she got dump by her husband for 3 weeks, and lived with her so she can keep heur house. She used to get angry if it took me more than 8 minutes to get to her house when I had to ge there. She made me feel guilty for seeing my parents and other friends. She weaponized my homosexuality against me so, so get a creepy guy out of her back, she made me tell him I was in love with her (which I was not). BUT she finally decided to date the guy, and never told him the truth. So he began sexually harassing me, because lesbians turn him on. She knew I couldn't let her children cry and stay in their filth, so she let them cry, and scream, until I took care of them so they feel good and safe.  
When her husband dumped her, she was obviously sad, so she asked me to stay with her. Every time I wanted to go home and sleep in my place, with my cats, she cried, even if she was doing okay before. She made me feel guilty to let her alone. So I woke up very early to go home and stay with my cats, play with them, cuddle them. Sometimes, I leaved at 2am, while she was asleep, to spend time home. During this time, her husband was still in the house. I took care of the kids, because he started drinking, ans she was too sad to take care of them. And they felt all the stress so I put my life on hold for her and for them, because she needed me, and they needed me too. (they were 4 and 2). During this time, she dated the creep and they invited them to my apartment to have sex, so I couldn't sleep because of the noise. They started to touch each other in front of me, simulate sex in front of me, even though I said how it was hard for me.  
She used my traumas against me saying I should accept the harassment of her new boyfriend (the creep), because he speaks about me doing things to girls, ans watching them. But he often said he wanted to make me come, turn me heterosexual, and I just need ""the ONE true D"" to know I like it.

I know her since high school. She was one of my bully, but she took my side because the queen bee said ""if you speak to her, I'll never speak to you again"". And I became friend with her (I know...). After high school I met my first and only boyfriend (I'll get back to him after). Let's call him C. B never liked C. And during the 7years of relationship with him, it was just humiliation, violence, SA, mental abuse. So when I finally leaved him, I was a mess. I lived 300km from her, and she was there for me on internet (but we were friends IRL). Me being single was an opportunity for her. Now that I was single, I had no excuse to not give her time. During this time, my chronic illness was hitting hard. I walked with canes, I weighted 135kg, I was on AD, on anxiolytics, and struggling with the trauma of domestic abuse. And, I was working on my thesis, but it was hard. I had to give her all my times.  
I do novella role play since 2008. I showed her what it was in high school, and we were writing together, as I was writing with other people, and for myself. I had to write her every day, it had to be done before she ended work, and then the night was hers, because she wanted to write. If I was going out during the day, I had to take picture for her, tel her what I was doing, with who, and respond to her messages, to distract her because she was bored. She repeated that my thesis was pointless, like my degree, that I was wasted time. All of that made me drop off my degree. I felt alone in the city I was. I moved there for C. So I needed time out of the city, even though I liked it, to disconnect it from C. So, she made me move next to her home (5 minutes), and she got me a place at her job. Her creepy boyfriend worked there too.

Here's the big lines to the story. So we are know in July. She is getting divorced. Her ex husband took my appartement, and I moved with her so she could keep her house (I was supposed to pay her rent). I felt it was a bad idea. But I did it anyway, saying myself that if I didn't feel well with her, I had money to move out, and stop this friend ship, but I needed to see where this idea will go.  
She wasn't supposed to live with her creepy boyfriend. But he was there all the times. Once, the even got out of her room naked, because the youngest was crying in front of the door, and she asked me to put him in front the TV so he stops crying, because it made her boyfriend uncomfortable for sex. I said no. So she took care of her kid herself.  
Living with her, I decided I do my chores only, I was no longer her baby sitter too. I took care of my four cats, her dog, and her too cats though. But my cats had their litter in my room, and I paid for litter for all the cats, and dit litter for al the cats. And feed all the animals.  
Also, the was waiting for me to contract a 30k loan at the bank, that I DIDN'T DO.

Since B had her creepy boyfriend, she treated me more and more badly (but she was abusive and controlling all of the beginning). I was doing a therapy because my ex boyfriend wasn't the first abusive person in my life (at the time I didn't identify B as abusive), and I wanted to stop the cycle, work on myself, and heal from the trauma he inflicted me. During the process, I identified her as abusive. And repeated myself ""maybe she is the last toxic relationship you have, if she don't respect your new boundaries"". I decided to regain my life. Because I stopped doing novella role play with anyone but her, I also stopped writing on my book, and drawing. I'm a freelance illustrator since 2019. But she made me stop drawing...  
So I started doing role play again, and also seeing my friends again. I didn't care of her guilt trip anymore. And I decided to go for a trip to my old city, 300km away, for a surprise anniversary to a close friend that I didn't see since I moved out.  
So the 27 of July, I take the road, and I go on my week end. My cats are in my room, they have food, water, I go back home the next day. She don't have to take care of them, and I juste want to see my friends. This day, I receive threat messages from her creepy boyfriend saying I'm a b\*tch, I can speak to him anymore, I can't look at him, I don't exist. Why ? He learned that I shared my concerns about him.

B and me had a new friend she introduced me : D. I shared to her, that I was feeling so uncomfortable with him, that I hated the sexual harassment. Also, that he was manipulative, and abusive to B. Why ? Because he told me. And I always told her, and him, that he was a creep, abusive, and manipulative. He loved telling me all about their sex life, because the first time, B shared to me how it was. Since, he told me every morning how he was doing her (remember he thinks I'm in love with her, she never told him the truth). Every disgusting homophobic and sexual words he said to me, I responded that he had to stop, he was disgusted, and I thought he was creepy. When he told me their sex life, he described me SA. he ""got in the wrong hole"" of he ""did in by the back door while she was drunk"" or ""doing her stuff while she was asleep"". I discussed it with B, and the said she knew it wasn't mistake, and normal. I said to her I was there for her, but she couldn't forced me to like him, because he was dangerous.  
Anyway, they both new how I felt, but I made the mistake to speak to D. I shouldn't speak to her.  
B also sent me threat messages. I asked her if she knew what her boyfriend has told me, she said yes, and he was right, because he was angry. So I stopped responded. But she kept sending messages other and other. I panicked. Because they were crazy and dangerous, and my cats were at there.

My cats are my babies, my life. I love them so much. I need to spend time with them, take care of them. And I hate myself for the time she made me sleep at her home during the breakup, because I couldn't spend enough time with them.  
I was so scared they hurt them that I kinda turned crazy. I called my dad, who was at 400km from B (and she knew my family was in vacation), asking him if I could go home with my cats. I explained to him what happened, sent the messages. I was saying other and other that they will hurt my cats and I wanted my cats. To calm me, he called her. She tried to turn my parents against me. So my sister took the phone and said that I was going home the next day (Sunday), and that my parents will be there. We will be discussing the issue, I will be taking clothes, my cats, and that I will be getting back during the week to get all the rest of my stuff. But she really better not to hurt my cats, because if she does, we will go to the police. She said she won't hurt them.  
This kinda calm me. But I was really scared of the Sunday evening.  
The 28, at 9AM, my dad calls me saying they are living right know, because she is throwing all of my stuff in the streets. I turned crazy again. I had trouble breathing. I was crying, shaking, and I couldn't saying anything else than ""my cats."" because if she was throwing my stuffs in the street, where were my cats ? And I wasn't able to drive, my family were at 4h drive away. My dad had the chance to have a friend needy with his truck. He was visiting his daughter. So they took the truck and got my stuffs. Creepy boyfriend got physical against the daughter and threatened her. B's mother and creepy boyfriend were violent and throwing all things away. B's dad was sad. And she didn't said anything.

Please take note that this what has been told me, because I wasn't there.

My parents arrived hours after and my cats were dehydrated. I have 4. So two were in a cat box, one in a cat box, and on in a paper box (the one we use to move, the brown one). They had diarrhea on the road (1h of road to return to my parents home), and they were really really thirsty. Because it was 31¬∞C, and they were in the sun. But my parents took care of them.  
I got home the next day, the 29. A blocked her everywhere, so as her family, friends, our colleagues, her boyfriend, everyone. It took me 5h instead of 3 to go home because I was in shock, and tired. Back home, I discovered my stuffed... there was garbage in there. I threw 4 100l bags of garbage. And I tried to save what she hadn't broke.

Now, I'm still at my parents home, and my babies are doing really good. They are happy, and with me. But I'm a mess. All I wrote isn't all this relationship. She threw tantrum because I had a girlfriend, she tried to still on of my book, she juste shattered every piece of me, everything I tried to built myself. If something wasn't her, it didn't count. She ruined a client/tatoo artiste relationship because it was my tattoo artist, the was always talking bad of me. I lost 40 kg in one year, I don't use cane anymore, juste because, living with myself, I cooked healthy meals, and I was doing sport. And not having someone hitting me all the time helped not feeling hurt all the time. But she had lost 60 kg by sleeve, so she hated when people congratulated me. She hatted when I got complimented about my look, my art, everything. And I learned she told everyone at work I was stupid because I was autistic. That she made me move there because I had no life where I was (I had a life, and friends).

Anyway... I just feel garbage. Because she wasn't the only one. My exboyfriend SA me so many times... he used to beat me, but not when he was angry, si I didn't understand it wasn't normal. He beat me for fun, for joke. Out of nowhere I could got a fist, or a slap in thr face or body. He forced me to sleep in his fluid because I wasn't aloud to change the sheets after he finished. I had to chose all other me, or in the sheet... he used to pee on my in the shower, and smash my head in his fluids... he broke me. he dehumanized me. And he wasn't the worst. I leaved him because I was often crying seeing girls couple. Because I'll never have this in my life. I spoke to it with my therapist, saying it will pass, it was a phase. He told me it wasn't a phase, that I was homosexual, and I can take the time I need to accept it. But it will never pass. Three days later, I broke up with my ex, because I was a lesbian. And I figured all the violence I was living in AFTER the break up.

He wasn't the first one. B wasn't the first one. The first toxic relationship I had. A. Was a 13yo girl, I was 12. I have a lot of amnesia about her. But she SA me multiple time saying it was to ""learn for the boys later"". If you know kanazuki no miko, she was obsessed with it. I never saw the anime. But the SA scene, I know it by heart, because she did it to me, I know the lines, I know everything. She made me do stuff, and she wanted us tou end each others lives. I didn't want to. So she wanted us to run away. I had impulse phobia. My autism wasn't diagnose, so I thought my meltdowns were insanity, that I was violent, and I will hurt my little sister. I thought I was a monster. I talked to A bout it. She said I was a monster. That I hurt people, I have the devil in me. And if I don't kill it, I'll be like a disease, I'll intoxicate people until I ruin their lives.  
I was so broken that the could made me do anything. One morning, I just said okay to run away. I have no memory for the run away. Juste me running in the fields (my parents live in the country) laughing. Then a black out. And my memories get back hours later, around 6PM. I'm sitting on a tree trunk. I turn my phone on. I see 42 voice mails. The last one if from my dad. So I listen to it. He is crying. He asked me to go back home, that he loves me, I'm his little kitty (he calls me that), they all need me home. A is laughing. And I don't know why, but I'm looking at here, horrifying by this person, and I call my dad.  
I still hear him screaming. He cries and asks me where I am. So I look around. I recognize a climbing spot I go in summer. But I'm on the top on the cliff. I climbed the cliff road and I have no memories. At the time I don't understand. But the cliff is 50m tall.  
I tell him I'm at the city cliff. And they he screams ""please little kitty don't jump. Don't jump. Please don't die. I love you.""

But I don't understand. I'm strongly calm. I say him that I won't jump, I'm sitting on a trunk. He beg me to wait for him. A don't speak to me anymore. Minutes after, my dad arrives with the police, and two police cars. One for each other. Back home, there's my mom crying, trying to calm my little sister, and A's mom, saying that I'm crazy and toxic. That I'm the one who told her daughter to do it.  
It wasn't the final point of A. My parents went to therapy with me to understand what to do. The therapist told them the emprise was so strong, they couldn't force me not to see her, I risked to run away again, or to heart myself. So they had to wait I stopped this friendship myself. It happened in the summer. Because A cut her wrist in front of my little sister with a knife, to punish me, because I didn't want to go to the pool with her. I took my sister with me to protect her, told A she was a crazy, and call my mom. I never spoke to A again. I went to an high school in a different city (it happened the year before high school) and I just ghosted her.

Since B throwed my stuffs on the street, I live with my parents. I'm continuing therapy. And I finally talked about A. Because I couldn't before. B was the only one who I spoke to about A. She forced me to tell all about it to her creepy boyfriend, to justify me not accepting the harassment (I had a ptsd attack during two days after). But I finally spoke about her to my therapist... And always thought that day on the cliff, if y hadn't turn on my phone, we would have jumped together. My therapist told me we wouldn't. She told me I would have. But A would just watched me. And I felt it was true. And it broke me even more.  
This girl could have kill me. She could have watch me jump off a 50meter cliff to feel less in distress, and I would have die without even know it.

I'm in violence since I'm 12. I understand why I had let B and C do me all this stuff. I understand why I accepted this, why I did things that destroyed my life, sometimes without them asking me to. A put all this in me.  
I was so scared to be the monster she told me I was that, to avoid being a bad person, avoid harming people I loved, I destroyed myself for other. I pushed my boundaries, I ignored reflags, I accepted unbelievable things. And I had to go to therapy to realize it wasn't normal at all. But why A ? Why her ? Why me ? And why all this ?

My therapist told me that now that I understand this, now that I don't ignore reflags anymore, now that I know my limits, and that I put my boundaries, I won't accepting this shit anymore. They are not afraid for me about this, they are sure I won't getting back to this shit. But when I think of me, when I look back all these years, I hate myself. I hate that accepted this, I hated that I excused them, I protected them.

What is my life know ? I used to write. I used to dream about publishing books. I was just about to succeed. I had clients, I had a shop, and a name as an illustrator. In a little circle, but it was growing, and I let B destroy this. I let her took my storied to be part of it. I let her make me doubt about my writing and I dumped my thesis... I let her staying away from my art. Writing, and drawing, that was mine. That was all I had. My thesis was my pride.

Since July, I try to get back that was mine. I registered to finish my thesis. I got all of my sketchbook back, and I reread all what I had written. I worked on what she tried to still me to getting my ideas back, and my story back. I took a subscription at sport club because I like it. But it's so hard.  
I'm finghting everyday. I have no energy, I can't focus. I love my thesis but working on it is just fucking hard. I love sport but going to the gym is violent for me. Because it's something I like, something I do for me. And all these years I was punished every time I did something for me. So when I go, I dissociate... I don't feel anything. I'm a robot.  
I can't spend time in silence. I always have to listen to podcast, or YouTube, or anything. Music is hard because my thought flow and overwhelmed me. I try to write. I made a list of all I have to work to start rewriting and reposting my book but every time I do a task, I get more and more scared. I loved sharing my book. I used to post on wattpad. I had my little community. But know I'm scared. I want to share but it froze me. I try to draw. I draw a little every time. I know I can draw. I know I'm good at it. I love to share it, but it's a fight to focus and not juste to throw everything away because it's pointless.

Everything gets more and more pointless. And I fight to keep the light in me. I don't want to not care anymore. I don't want to give up. I want to feel the joy to go to gym. I want to regain my pride self-confidence.  
I used to love reading, so I bought myself books. But I can't read. I can't because it's letting go. I can't letting words take me, I can't let them make me feel feelings I don't control. I can role-play. I got that back. Because I'm part of it. So I'm safe, I control. But why is it so damn hard to write ? I control when I'm writing, no ?  
I don't understand. I know I have to connect with myself but every time I try, I juste cry for ours, or I lie down with my cats purring and I look at the emptiness of my life. I'm almost 29, I didn't achieve anything. I'm just breathing.  
What I used to have, despite all this mess, B broke it. I'l fighting to rebuilt it.

I lived so many traumas, why this one is so hard ? is it because I know have to deal with the accumulation of all this years ? I don't think I'm ready for it but I have no choice.  
I'm scared of feeling empty. I'm scared of not getting back what I had. I'm scared of failing again in my dreams.  
I'm angry because it's part of my fault it all those things happened to me. I allowed it. I hate my past self for that. And I'm scared of my know self. I don't know who I am.  
I can't have physical relationship. I kinda dating a girl I really like, but I'm scared of hurting her with all the mess I carry. I'm scared of hurting her if I'm not ready for physical stuffs. I'm also scared my therapist are wrong and I go back in hell again.  
I feel lonely. I kneed to connect with people but it's hard. My parents try their best to help me, but every time they question something, or ask what I am doing, or say that my make up is good, or I did a good video, I feel in danger, attacked, undercontrol, and I close myself. I hate myself for that, because it's so hard to be around me right know, I know it. But I can't control it.

I'm sad when I see what was my life. I'm sad when I realize I don't remember me before trauma. What I could have look like without them ? What I could be without all these wounds. And will it heal some day ? And when ? My life is a pile of broken things, rotten things. I juste had some precious dust in it, like my family, my cats, and those things that are mine, like writing, reading, drawing, role-playing, my hope for my thesis It's all I have know. It's so little. I can't lost it. I can't fail. But it's juste hard. And I don't want to end things, I don't want to stop feeling, I don't want to be empty.

Just, I know someone felt the same way that I do. I just need to her it gets better. I need to know how, and how long it took. I don't want to feel the need to die again. I don't want to go back in the dark place. I know it's just a hard time, but why is it so hard, I survived to so much worse than stuffs thrown in the street ?

I'm sorry is it's hard to understand to what I'm writing. I'm a bit confused.  
I juste want to get lost again, and I need to connect with people who understand. I tried to connect with writers, and illustrators.

I used to have an old user name (it was ophelia\_yeti) but I don't use it anymore. That why my account is so young. That old username was the nickname B gave me. She told that she created me because of it. I changed to have something that's mine. But no-one know me with this new name. I wasn't somebody but I used to have an identity, I have to rebuilt everything know. All I had, all I am.  
It even feels like I have tu just built me. I don't know if I have ever been before.

Again, I'm not in danger, and I have tho therapist. I'm not alone because I don't have apartment or furniture lol. But mostly because I know I can't live alone at the moment, I'm to fragile. It's not an alert, I won't hurt myself. I know there is hope, and it's will get better. But it's so hard I need so speak, and to get this of my chest. I need to not feel alone in the storm. It's just so hard. It's not a day and day fight, it's hour per hour. Every hour is a challenge, because I can feel empty and just look in the void, of cry, of fell relief, or angry. I never felt like this before. It's hard to understand and to getting through it.

I also don't know how to end this post... juste thank you if you read all of this. It's so big I doubt anyone will have the patience. If you didn't, don't worry. But if you did, juste thank you. And sorry for all this over sharing. I just hope you are doing better than me.

And please. Please, please please, listen to you, don't push your boundaries, don't ignore reflags, don't be me. Live YOUR life, be happy, and achieve your dreams ‚ù§Ô∏è

Anyways, I always kind of knew life would end this way, I just didn't expect to be in this specific position. This is what has made me decide to go ahead and do it and get it over with already.

Context : 18M , first year of college/first year of living alone , im pretty social and I‚Äôve friends , a loving family etc.. (Mr.Everybody )

For the past two months, I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôm slowly falling apart. Normally, when I decide to start or stop something, I do it without any trouble. But this time, it‚Äôs different.

I develop a certain porn addiction  (once a day) ‚ÄîBack in high school it never bothered me , I could go months without it. Now, I just can‚Äôt stop. I try, I hold on for a few weeks, then I relapse. I also spend way too much time doomscrolling on TikTok and Instagram. I delete the apps, but within days, I reinstall them. On top of that, I started drinking more regularly, and that scared me. A week ago, I decided to stop because I realized that the happiest moment of my day was when I was half-drunk. I‚Äôm not an alcoholic, but it make me realize how easy it is to become one . So I‚Äôd rather be sad but sober.

The worst part of that is that no one knows I feel this way. I‚Äôm the funny, social friend, always bringing the good vibes. I told my best friend I‚Äôve been feeling depressed, but I couldn‚Äôt go into detail‚ÄîI‚Äôm scared she‚Äôd see me as a fucking looser she will hate me for what i am now.

I hate myself because at 16, I was stronger than I am now. I‚Äôm painfully aware of everything I‚Äôm doing wrong, but that doesn‚Äôt stop me. Every day, it feels like I take one step forward and three steps back, and each day, that step forward gets harder. I don‚Äôt want to die, but I feel like I‚Äôm slowly fading away. The only thing that calms me is music. Without it, I can‚Äôt sleep, because then I start thinking about how much I‚Äôm wasting my life.

I want to break this cycle, but I don‚Äôt know how. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Please help me ",kill myself
1i864o4,how do i stop thinking about killing myself,MentalHealthSupport,1737646746.0,0,1,"hey everyone. im a 24 yo diagnosed with many disorders and still kinda lost on many aspects of how I work as a person. 
my diagnoses: 
- adhd (untreated, recently diagnosed, the prescribed medication doesn't help me feel better, and in some cases, have brought undesirable side effects) 
- borderline personality disorder (diagnosed when I was a teenager) 
- ocd (leaning into the obsessive aspect more than the compulsion one) 
- generalised anxiety disorder (a perfectly logical result of being non diagnosed and masking for most of my life) 

and lately, I've just been falling deeper and deeper into clinical depression.  I've been prescribed antidepressants and my addiction to cannabis got worse. I'm living at my parents place cause I can't find a job but the issue is, even if I did find a job, I dont think I'd be able to hold it. i am not mentally secure under my parents roof and it's been hell for me. 

lately I've been thinking a lot about killing myself. its all day on loop. the thing is, I have never done something as drastic as actually attempting or anything. i cut sometimes, not deep at all, which has always made me feel like a poser. it's the same with suicide: just thoughts, right. I never do anything. but it's still on loop all day. it's draining me. I cant speak about it to my close ones cause it makes me feel even more of a poser, pathetic, making up problems, attention whore; and overall makes me want to kill myself more. 

I hope this post isn't inappropriate, sorry if it is, I just feel so disarmed and idk what to do. any kind of advice welcome. thank you

I have a close person who constantly calls me and dumps all their trauma on me, for hours, with crying and screaming and complains. This goes years and years back. And while I know I should be supportive and nice and full of understanding, I feel overwhelmed and I can't do this anymore. I do care about that person a lot, but I can't, for the 200th time, listed to hour, two or three hours of same stories, same trauma, crying, problems and be expected to be supportive and prasing and full of understanding while I hardly ever get the same treatment if ever. If I try to say anything about my problems, I got shut down immediatelly, and I am told my problems are ""nothing, minor"" compaired to theirs, and then the focus is again on other person.

And yes, I tried, so so many times, to give as much constructive advices I could, I did researches, I gave my best, I tried, but that person always has ""excuse"" why that's ""impossible"" for them and why it can't be done (I think it really can f you want to). Sometimes, I am like ""this has to work!"" and they just shut me down, and keep on complainng without even tryung. This goes so fat that I feel traumatized whenever they call me and after the call I have to take sedatives for days to calm down, because I feel like it's getting worse. Sometimes, this person sounds quite irrational and when I point that and possible grattitudes they could have (ths person really COULD live great life only if they wanted, they could have everything!), all the blessings they have, they shut me down, start screaming how I don't understand, how I am not supportive, mentions self-harm, and then yells at me for being horrible to them.

Whatever I say is wrong. I feel like I can't deal with this, I can't win. They refuse to see a professional because they think the whole world is against them and their point is the only correct. It goes so far that everyone is their enemy and they are perpetual victim and martyr. I am starting to avoid that person because I can't deal with that. They refuse ANY help it appears that they just want to dump all the trauma on me. And I can't really anymore, whatever I say is wrong and I do not get the same support in return because apparently, my life is easy and perfect (spoiler: it is NOT).

I don't know what to do? I feel like giving up. I know I shouldn't and I am really scared of those self-harm threats but I lost all the ideas of how to react, what to say and how to help.

1hoxn8h,Self obsession and how I function ,MentalHealthSupport,1735484289.0,21,2,"i fuck over people and ruin them cause im bored and can't build bonds with anyone cause I lack empathy or morals. I use people for their looks, status.

 a place to stay and for attention and praise. it's like I'm some sort of creature creating a mask. playing a role and stripping others of my illusion when im bored with them. 

and then I feed on their attention.
ive been like this sense i was young. always being in charge in friend groups always causing drama in friend groups even being nicknamed ""boss"" because I  was always being asked for advice. 

I make an effort when it comes to trying to ruin and sabotage everyone around me.

 In school i often ended up feeling like a cult leader with large groups of people who would listen to me no matter what. When i was really young at recess I even convinced  kids to shove other kids down a ice hill in the playground, causing head injuries. 

Because I liked the power. 

I calculate every interaction and moments with people. I gage how innocent and nieve they are I learn their weaknesses and I use those to my advantage.

 In school i would read history books and imagine myself as the kings and gods we learned about. I had fantasies of stomping on people who spoke against me. and having complete control. 

my mother is self obsessed. so is my father. and they speak horribly of everyone else but themselves. I spend my days in grandiose day dreams that feel like reality. like im walking through a simulation. people praising me, cameras flashing.

 cheering. For me it feels like I'm on a TV show like there's always a camera infront of me and no matter what even if I was laying in a hospital bed after an accident with no limbs I would still feel like a God. 

I know if I were to help the homeless or needy it would only be for the attention and praise I get.

 And if i got something horrible like cancer i know i would use it my advantage. I think im the best compared to Einstein, compared to any actor or actress and even to doctors and millionares. 

Like im something better then all these useless bags of shit called people.  sometimes I'm a king on a thrown. sometimes I'm a cruel dictator. 

sometimes I'm a cowboy in the west. but no matter what I still think I am the best. and it feels like i need attention to survive. i hate people but I love what they feed me.

 I love how nieve they are I especially love mentally challanged people who are easily manipulated, i love dating disabled people because i can get away with more and i can use their disabilities to get attention for myself. I love acting as if I care about them and their hobbies.

 I pretend we have the same interests I like seeing their hearts shatter. i enjoy the chaos.  I somewhat like leading people on having long long late night convos only to hang up the phone and not give a damn about what we had talked about. 

I dish out detailed emotinal advice to convince people im good in order to get close to them. It makes the rush at the end more intense. 

Most of my relationships die off within a few months cause i either get caught being shitty which causes me to sometimes crumble if the blow is big enough. I get more isolated. 

Less social and i have to build myself up again and re build my persona and wait it out till I have enough manipulative energy to venture out and try to manipulate people again. 

or i expose my true thoughts due to being bored of the conversation.sometimes of a person is physically attractive enough ill try to save them from myself. 

I use people for emotinal ranting all my friends in the past and now have been neglected but if they dont listen to my hour long rants followed by attention and support i get pissed and blackmail them using our relationship. 

Turning people against eachother. blackmailing people. getting my friends to bash and attack others. i love playing the role of the hero. helping people anytime they ask. always being the friend people go to. 

i know exactly what to say so much so that  some of my victims try to convince me im good even though im telling them to their face that I'm rotten to my core. I don't wish to change. i don't really give a shit that I hurt people. people are waists of space in my eyes. boring. Tiring. 

loud and annoying. the only reason i would wanna change is to make sure more people stick around so I can gain stuff from them and so i can keep supplying myself with attention. when i date my partners aren't seen as better then me or even equal they are seen as lesser like everyone else to me.


 an accesory an item i become very obsessed with my partners looks because they make ME look better.l Rarely actually feel a connection with others. But I can fake it easily.

  I remember all the mental pain I've caused others like they are a picture book in my mind. Remembering messed up texts ive sent. Sending Pictures of pets that ive shared with partners that have died of natural causes only to use it as ammunition and to make them cry 

 .Remembering all the praise I've gotten in the past when I feel low on attention. I re live everytime I've scared people with my confessions. 

I especially love when they try ro convinve me that im wrong and this ""isn't the real me"". 

So to fix that I just let them know that I've never felt any connection and only usually a small sliver of remorse for the pain they've experienced before meeting me but usually I don't feel any pity for the people I screw over. 

I have an obsession with having full control and having a partner as some sort of disipal. My morals are almost nonexistent. 

I tend to fake my morals aswell I claim i love women but I think the majority of them are disgusting. I guess you could call me a misogynist. 

If I could hit a partner I would because of that control type feeling. If i have kuds in the future ive realized ill probably force them into religoin just so i can get more control.

 And I lack alot of other morals that are definitely concerning I know what's right in society's eyes and to the typical person but I just dont care unless I'm trying to charm someone. 

Life is usually boring and I constantly feel underwhelmed.

Sense I was young I've always known about my behavior. And how it differs from others. I've watched TV shows in order to learn how to interact properly with others.

 But for the longest time I was in total denial that im full of myself and grandiose despite people yelling it at me and saying I'm thr worst, till I was manipulated by someone much stronger. 

Someone who suffocated me with their lies and manipulation just like i do to others, someone Who gave me the illusion that I was always in control. And I wasn't.

 And that woke me up fully after meeting the first person who could match me in manipulation and abuse. I'm getting a psycological evaluation today. So just wanted to share how i act. 


 And made me really think about all of this. It felt like I could open my eyes, like the fog had cleared and I could see breathing, sleeping and alive people around me for the first time.

 Because before I got knocked down I was so self absorbed that I didn't even recognize people were beside me. Now i can see my grandiosity.

1e33vhv,What do you do when you feel like there's no one to give you a reason to live?,MentalHealthSupport,1720967956.0,0,1,"greetings. New here . nothing further than the above.

1jca5se,Only one person came to my birthday celebration tonight and I feel so bitterly depressed and lonely. How do I go forward?,MentalHealthSupport,1742087544.0,9,10,"Tonight was my birthday celebration and only one person showed up. We did our best to have a good time but it felt awkward and I wish I hadn't bothered.

I'm both depressed and extremely angry about this, even though most people dropped out for legit reasons but a few others were flakes who I think could have communicated better with me. I'm not actually angry at anyone in particular as nobody owes me their time but I am absolutely fed up to absolute death of not feeling like a priority in anyone's life. I attended multiple friend's 30ths recently where dozens of people showed up for a big dance hall party and I have to deal with basically nobody in my life celebrating me? I've brought this feeling up on Reddit before and some replies amounted to 'why are you as a grown man upset nobody came to your birthday? What are you, a child?' which doesn't help this feeling and frankly is a c**ty thing to say.

It's on me to improve this for myself, as I am admittedly absolutely terrible at making meaningful connections with people out of fear and growing up with worthless role models. But I cannot keep living like this, I am so fucking lonely and change feels impossible. I will no doubt get loads of messages and questions asking how it went and I don't know how to react honestly without looking like a bitter asshole or a giant loser. I don't know how to change my life and be honest in making better connections and relationships with people because I don't know how to value myself in these moments.

1j7wam6,long vent from a tired 20 y/o,MentalHealthSupport,1741605570.0,10,8,"hi, i‚Äôve never really posted on reddit before, and i honestly don‚Äôt know why i‚Äôm doing this because i feel pretty decided, but i kind of just want to get this off my chest. i am 20 years old and i have nothing going for me. i have struggled with very severe depression my whole life, and it is debilitating. therapy, meds, nothing helps. i have no goals, no passion for anything, and no talent in anything. i feel like im not a very good person. i am selfish and unattractive and overall i just hate myself. i wake up in the morning and the only thing that plagues my mind all day is that i wish i could crawl out of my skin and swap bodies with somebody else. i don‚Äôt really know if i believe in heaven or hell, or even reincarnation and whatnot, but i think to myself, whatever comes next can‚Äôt be as bad as it is here. i have a boyfriend who i love dearly and whom loves me very much but i feel like ive brought nothing but negativity to him. he always says he wouldn‚Äôt want to go on without me, and that‚Äôs honestly the only thing that has kept me here for so long. but i‚Äôm so tired guys. i‚Äôm so exhausted. i‚Äôm tired of waking up every day and hating myself to my very core. i‚Äôm tired of waking up and seeing my friends and siblings do things with their lives, accomplish things, but i feel stuck. i am tired of waking up and fantasizing about not being here anymore all day. i am tired of feeling guilty over how badly i want to end it. i am tired. i see no future where i am happy doing anything. i dont know what to do. i got into an argument with my boyfriend tonight due to me being insecure, and he blew up on me, and it was pretty warranted but i feel like all i do is bring negativity to those around me and that the world would honestly be a happier place without me in it. i don‚Äôt mean to be all ‚Äúwoe is me‚Äù but its honest to god just how i feel. tonight after we fought i sat in my bathtub sobbing, begging for some sign that i should stay, and nothing. i‚Äôve never been very religious, but i needed something, anything really. i constantly feel like a disappointment to those around me (my parents have said that i am to my face), and i feel like ending it, one big reason for them to be disappointed in me, would be better than a lifetime of reasons. i want nothing more than to be at peace. to finally rest. to finally not have these thoughts 24/7. to not feel this uttermost hatred towards myself. i am exhausted guys. again i dont really know why im posting this but i really feel as if i am reaching the end of my rope. if you‚Äôve made it this far, thanks for reading i guess, maybe ill stick around and you‚Äôll hear from me again but we‚Äôll see ",no reason to live
1hoxn8h,Self obsession and how I function ,MentalHealthSupport,1735484289.0,21,2,"i fuck over people and ruin them cause im bored and can't build bonds with anyone cause I lack empathy or morals. I use people for their looks, status.

 a place to stay and for attention and praise. it's like I'm some sort of creature creating a mask. playing a role and stripping others of my illusion when im bored with them. 

and then I feed on their attention.
ive been like this sense i was young. always being in charge in friend groups always causing drama in friend groups even being nicknamed ""boss"" because I  was always being asked for advice. 

I make an effort when it comes to trying to ruin and sabotage everyone around me.

 In school i often ended up feeling like a cult leader with large groups of people who would listen to me no matter what. When i was really young at recess I even convinced  kids to shove other kids down a ice hill in the playground, causing head injuries. 

Because I liked the power. 

I calculate every interaction and moments with people. I gage how innocent and nieve they are I learn their weaknesses and I use those to my advantage.

 In school i would read history books and imagine myself as the kings and gods we learned about. I had fantasies of stomping on people who spoke against me. and having complete control. 

my mother is self obsessed. so is my father. and they speak horribly of everyone else but themselves. I spend my days in grandiose day dreams that feel like reality. like im walking through a simulation. people praising me, cameras flashing.

 cheering. For me it feels like I'm on a TV show like there's always a camera infront of me and no matter what even if I was laying in a hospital bed after an accident with no limbs I would still feel like a God. 

I know if I were to help the homeless or needy it would only be for the attention and praise I get.

 And if i got something horrible like cancer i know i would use it my advantage. I think im the best compared to Einstein, compared to any actor or actress and even to doctors and millionares. 

Like im something better then all these useless bags of shit called people.  sometimes I'm a king on a thrown. sometimes I'm a cruel dictator. 

sometimes I'm a cowboy in the west. but no matter what I still think I am the best. and it feels like i need attention to survive. i hate people but I love what they feed me.

 I love how nieve they are I especially love mentally challanged people who are easily manipulated, i love dating disabled people because i can get away with more and i can use their disabilities to get attention for myself. I love acting as if I care about them and their hobbies.

 I pretend we have the same interests I like seeing their hearts shatter. i enjoy the chaos.  I somewhat like leading people on having long long late night convos only to hang up the phone and not give a damn about what we had talked about. 

I dish out detailed emotinal advice to convince people im good in order to get close to them. It makes the rush at the end more intense. 

Most of my relationships die off within a few months cause i either get caught being shitty which causes me to sometimes crumble if the blow is big enough. I get more isolated. 

Less social and i have to build myself up again and re build my persona and wait it out till I have enough manipulative energy to venture out and try to manipulate people again. 

or i expose my true thoughts due to being bored of the conversation.sometimes of a person is physically attractive enough ill try to save them from myself. 

I use people for emotinal ranting all my friends in the past and now have been neglected but if they dont listen to my hour long rants followed by attention and support i get pissed and blackmail them using our relationship. 

Turning people against eachother. blackmailing people. getting my friends to bash and attack others. i love playing the role of the hero. helping people anytime they ask. always being the friend people go to. 

i know exactly what to say so much so that  some of my victims try to convince me im good even though im telling them to their face that I'm rotten to my core. I don't wish to change. i don't really give a shit that I hurt people. people are waists of space in my eyes. boring. Tiring. 

loud and annoying. the only reason i would wanna change is to make sure more people stick around so I can gain stuff from them and so i can keep supplying myself with attention. when i date my partners aren't seen as better then me or even equal they are seen as lesser like everyone else to me.


 an accesory an item i become very obsessed with my partners looks because they make ME look better.l Rarely actually feel a connection with others. But I can fake it easily.

  I remember all the mental pain I've caused others like they are a picture book in my mind. Remembering messed up texts ive sent. Sending Pictures of pets that ive shared with partners that have died of natural causes only to use it as ammunition and to make them cry 

 .Remembering all the praise I've gotten in the past when I feel low on attention. I re live everytime I've scared people with my confessions. 

I especially love when they try ro convinve me that im wrong and this ""isn't the real me"". 

So to fix that I just let them know that I've never felt any connection and only usually a small sliver of remorse for the pain they've experienced before meeting me but usually I don't feel any pity for the people I screw over. 

I have an obsession with having full control and having a partner as some sort of disipal. My morals are almost nonexistent. 

I tend to fake my morals aswell I claim i love women but I think the majority of them are disgusting. I guess you could call me a misogynist. 

If I could hit a partner I would because of that control type feeling. If i have kuds in the future ive realized ill probably force them into religoin just so i can get more control.

 And I lack alot of other morals that are definitely concerning I know what's right in society's eyes and to the typical person but I just dont care unless I'm trying to charm someone. 

Life is usually boring and I constantly feel underwhelmed.

Sense I was young I've always known about my behavior. And how it differs from others. I've watched TV shows in order to learn how to interact properly with others.

 But for the longest time I was in total denial that im full of myself and grandiose despite people yelling it at me and saying I'm thr worst, till I was manipulated by someone much stronger. 

Someone who suffocated me with their lies and manipulation just like i do to others, someone Who gave me the illusion that I was always in control. And I wasn't.

 And that woke me up fully after meeting the first person who could match me in manipulation and abuse. I'm getting a psycological evaluation today. So just wanted to share how i act. 


 And made me really think about all of this. It felt like I could open my eyes, like the fog had cleared and I could see breathing, sleeping and alive people around me for the first time.

 Because before I got knocked down I was so self absorbed that I didn't even recognize people were beside me. Now i can see my grandiosity.

1jljevy,My psychiatrist is threading to ‚Äúexpose‚Äù me to my parents,MentalHealthSupport,1743124730.0,4,3,"Hey guys i‚Äôm in a bit of a situation and I want to know how to navigate this. Background info i‚Äôm 20f and currently i‚Äôve been withdrawn from school. Around a month ago i tried taking my life. I was withdrawn from school but i wasn‚Äôt made aware of it until 3 weeks in and we already found a place for me to stay. Basically the issue is i‚Äôm not in school but i‚Äôm living in an apartment paid by my parents for me to be close to school. Now me not being enrolled is on me, i had a horrible incident that i won‚Äôt get into details but long story short, horrible experience in my first year (witnessing sewer slide, attempted murder, abuse etc.) all on my own it caused me to not perform well in my classes and i was incredibly mentally i‚Äôll - i‚Äôm not making that an excuse for my faliures but just the reason and i take full accountability of it. ( I can always clarify if you guhs have questions). This issue is, i cannot tell my parents, that‚Äôs literally a non-negotiable i‚Äôve tried and it never ends well. My parents are indian immigrants and they‚Äôve worked their butts off for me, please know i feel guilty about it all the time, i appreciate their help so much but they also are not the type to understand mental health and the second they get angry they don‚Äôt care. (ex. mom blamed brothers depression on me, told me dad once i was suicidal when i was younger and. he comforted me for him to then deny that ever happening and that i have no reason to feel that way and it‚Äôs my fault). What i‚Äôm trying to say is I can‚Äôt tell them that i have severe depression, anxiety and ptsd that resulted in my failing because to them that wouldn‚Äôt be an excuse. You guys might try to convince me and maybe this is where i‚Äôm being dense but i just know my parents and it wouldn‚Äôt work. They are not open minded at all, and to a getter their anger is justified becuase i‚Äôve wasted all their hard earned money even though yes it was out of my control i still could‚Äôve done something, i shouldn‚Äôt have been so weak. Onto why I‚Äôm making this post, when i tried, i was found by my mom and taken to the hospital. There they kept me overnight and i explained this exact situation to my psychiatrist and nurses. However when i had my meeting with my psychiatrist he told me he‚Äôs going to tell my parents there and then, i managed to convince him not to but he followed up with saying that I need to meet him in a month (currently now in like a week or so-ish) and if i haven‚Äôt told them, he‚Äôs going to send an anonymous message to my mom saying i failed uni. Now here‚Äôs the issue, i absolutely understand that in his pov this is the safest route for me but i know my family will be ruined with this info and my parents will lose it. I‚Äôve reflected and i know that this isn‚Äôt something i want to die over so i‚Äôll relay that info to my psychiatrist but i also somehow need to explain that after he threatened me with telling me parents, i tried this month to hint at my situation and they‚Äôve completely shut it down. They act like what happened didn‚Äôt ever happen. My mom has blamed me and made it about herself, just very typical i don‚Äôt believe in mental health actions. But i wanted to know, I also understand there is pt confidentiality systems set in place and him threatening only just increased my anxiety. The whole time we spoke he only continued to shame me and my feelings and mitigate them. I understand having a blunt and real approach is sometimes necessary for pts but he was completely rude and dismissive. I‚Äôm really nervous that when i go back he‚Äôs going to ignore what i say and put me into a bigger problem, i feel very lost i don‚Äôt know where to post this or where to go. If anyone has advice i‚Äôll greatly appreciate it. I know it might seem confusing and i apologize but i will do my best to clarify anything and if you guys know where else i could post this for help too. ",no reason to live
1javjj9,"I feel like I should be happy, but I‚Äôm not",MentalHealthSupport,1741925627.0,4,8,"I‚Äôm a 22M, in my last year of college. I don‚Äôt think I have a single reason to keep living other than ‚Äúmy mom will be sad‚Äù. My last relationship was 3 years ago, and I don‚Äôt think my friends would care too much if I just disappeared - we‚Äôre not that close anyway.

I‚Äôm not happy at all. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm job hunting right now (in software industry, so a bit tough right now). I have never enjoyed my major - I got into it for the money, and the money is pretty good to be fair. I‚Äôve felt pretty anxious every time I job searched, but this time is the worst by far. I didn‚Äôt get the return offer from an internship I worked my ass off in, and my current internship just had layoffs and a hiring freeze. I‚Äôm an anxious person, and I feel like that doubled my anxiety. And my worry is that I would keep feeling like this even after I find a job.

I‚Äôve always had a problem with comparing myself with others. It feels like everyone is ahead of me. I tried so hard, but every night I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúwhy is nothing working out for me?‚Äù. I see all my friends with great jobs, and everyone on LinkedIn getting positions that I would love to have. I also see a lot of people my age born into retirement money or getting lucky / grinding something for a few years to become rich and retire. I know everyone wants this, but I don‚Äôt even want to work, I just want to retire. The thought of working another 40 years for no reason dreads me. I even thought of gambling my savings and just dying if it didn‚Äôt work out. I‚Äôve tried so hard, even paid for therapy out of my own pocket to stop myself from comparing myself to others but I can‚Äôt seem to get rid of this trait of mine.

But I feel like I should be happy. I have a loving family. I grew up in a decently wealthy family and I have a pretty good amount saved up from my internships, probably top 5% in my age group. There are so many people that have it much worse than me, and I feel like there is no reason for me to feel this sad. But I do.

I‚Äôm breaking down several times per day crying. Everytime I see my family I want to cry, and I avoid them everytime I get teary eyed. I don‚Äôt want my family to worry because of me. Once my mom told me not to stress too much and that everything will be okay, and I almost broke down crying on the spot. I can‚Äôt fall asleep without edibles. I think I had my first anxiety attack today, and I‚Äôm losing my ability to focus every day. I‚Äôm going to bomb my few interviews that I managed to get at this rate, and I know I‚Äôd feel even worse if that happened. I know what I have to do. Just lock in for a few months to grind out for a job, but I just can‚Äôt seem to do it.

I know there are issues with my personality. I have trouble making friends anywhere and always feel like an outsider. I think I‚Äôm on the autism spectrum, and maybe slightly sociopathic as well. I hate the anxious and depressed trait of mine. I think all this is inherited from my parents - my dad suffers from the same anxiety (i think), and both my parents are slightly sociopathic and always outsiders. I don‚Äôt want kids simply because I‚Äôm worried my child will have to go through the same life that I am living right now.

Why am I so unhappy? When will I find happiness? Why should I keep living? What is my purpose? I know I‚Äôm supposed to be still young, but I feel like I have nothing to live for and nothing to look forward to.",no reason to live
1hm73mb,What is wrong with me?,MentalHealthSupport,1735154611.0,14,9,"Ok, I'll keep this simple: I have seen a lot of signs of things that don't make sense. I don't think it is depression, but I want to hear your guy's opinions. I don't have money right now to go to the doctor to get checked out, and the fact that I don't know what this is is driving me up the wall, so these are my biggest things 

I will make sounds sometimes for no reason or will make that sound with different tones to mimic talking (mep being the sound)
I can get overwhelmed sometimes (for example, at work, my co-worker has been picking up on the fact if there are a lot of customers that need help, I can get overwhelmed quite easily)
I have no motivation. I'm in a self-paced homeschool with no teachers, and we are almost halfway through the school year. I have nothing done 
And that gose into my hygiene is horrendous. I have a cavity and rarely brush my teeth. I don't wash my clothes at all. I forget the last time I washed them. I shower once a week, and I hate that so much. I know I'm disgusting, but when it comes to fixing it, I have no willpower to do anything, and I think I've lived this way for so long that even though I'm disgusted by it, I don't know what my room/ hygiene should look like.

1jipihf,I don't know what to do,MentalHealthSupport,1742819465.0,2,2,"I generally don't know what to do with my life.
I can't feel emotions or empathy, I'm just empty all the time. I don't want to do anything at all either, and the only reason for that is that I don't see the point. I'm just going to die one day so why does what I do in the meantime matter? I know I hate my family, and I don't have any friends, not that it changes anything. I don't have anyone to turn to, I'm truly alone. When I look to the future, I don't see the point in it. Why bother when you'll die and then be forgotten one day? I'm hopeless, and I don't know what to do to change it. No matter what I do I don't feel, I don't love and I don't care. What's the point in life if living itself can be so cruel?

I don't know nor do I understand what I am supposed to do in life. I was always called a genius kid or an old soul. But because of this, I was never told how to try, I was always comfortable with being the way I was. So much so that I never tried to improve, and look where that got me. I don't even know if there's anything I can do to feel better. I go to a therapist and have been for the past year, but all that's got me is online schooling and that isn't even helping. I feel like I just need to be locked away and forgotten, maybe that would be the best outcome.


I'm sorry if this was too much or too heavy of a subject but I really needed to get this off of my mind. I don't know if anything could help me at this point but if anyone at all has ideas of what I can do to try and feel better please tell me.

1ipg32c,A list of (mostly) everything I have to deal with,MentalHealthSupport,1739554612.0,7,3,"Sorry, this is gonna be long.

HIGH SCHOOL:

Not as bad or as difficult as it could be, but still adds more stress to my life. Not super boring, not super fun. The main issue is my first class, which is a college class. We meet every Thursday and you're expected to read a digital textbook and complete an assignment by the following Wednesday. The problem is it's difficult to keep up with, you can't turn in work after the deadline, and I don't do work till nearing the deadline and I can't do work at home (elaborated on further below), so I've missed most assignments. Most of the time I'm exhausted when I get home.

MENTAL HEALTH:

‚Ä¢ ADHD: This is the reason why I can't do schoolwork unless I'm at school. Executive dysfunction makes it to where I can't shower unless my parents aren't home, I can't brush my teeth, I can't exercise, I can't wash my hands (there are a few exceptions), I can't wear underwear, it makes it practically impossible to stay hygienic. Then there's the overstimulation, which makes everything I'm dealing with harder to deal with. Medicine only helps so much, actually have an appointment about it Monday. I'm always seeking dopamine, don't get it often. It's actually why I hate weekends, got nothing to do. This makes me bored which then increases my anxiety (elaborated below).

‚Ä¢ OCD: ADHD's right hand man, as it turns out. This increases my anxiety when I'm bored, since I have nothing to distract me. Part of why I can't shower unless my parents aren't home. People look at me like I'm crazy when I touch things a specific way, or type in a weird pattern, or leave the bathroom immediately after flushing (part of why I don't wash my hands). If I'm in a public restroom and flush a toilet, I have to plug my ears, not because it's loud but because OCD. Intrusive thoughts galore, it's often difficult to tell if a violent thought is intrusive because I usually feel happier with those thoughts. I also have a habit of nail biting, both finger and toe, and pulling my hair. The nail biting has disfigured my nails, often times there's dried blood in them. Since I rarely wash my hands, biting my nails spreads hundreds of germs to things I touch.

‚Ä¢ Autism: Not gonna elaborate on this too much since it's similar to ADHD and I'm not entirely sure I have it. I was diagnosed when I was in elementary, the diagnosis was changed to ADHD in mid 2022. Pretty likely I have it since my brother is autistic and over half of people with ADHD also have autism.

‚Ä¢ Depression: A result of ADHD and OCD. Especially with everything going on right now, I've been feeling more and more hopeless day after day. Idk if it's because I'm so exhausted after school, but I've been more tired recently. Antidepressants worked in the past, I can't tell if they're still working.

‚Ä¢ Entertainment: My controller broke last week and I'm supposed to be getting a new one next week. Until then, I have to rely on YouTube, Reddit, music, and Balatro. Nothing new on YouTube, lot's of politics on Reddit (elaborated later), only so much entertainment from music, and Balatro is slowly becoming boring. It feels like everyday is the same, especially since I can't use my Playstation till next week.

‚Ä¢ Identity: Never thought I'd question my sexuality and gender, but here we are. I stopped caring about dating and sex when I realized that I don't understand women. I have nothing against them, I just don't get them. I understand men, because I am one; we have the same hormones. I'm attracted to women, but only physically, as I can't understand them mentally. After that realization, I've identified as aroace. However, after seeing some lesbian porn (no seriously), I asked myself, ""What if I was a girl? Then I'd be attracted to women both physically and mentally"". It's led to a lot of introspection and research, and I hate to say it, but I'm too scared to transition. I mean I have a deep voice, I'm 6 foot tall, super hairy, enjoy what people consider masculine things. I've seen some incredible transitions, but it doesn't look amazing immediately. I tried looking more feminine one night, but it was so embarrassing even though no one else saw me. It's also too dangerous to transition right now (all because of that orange bastard), too costly, and my parents wouldn't support it. Recently I questioned if I was agender after discovering that gender has no use anymore. For any kind of document, I list my gender as ""prefer not to say"". If it's not there, I put ""male"".

Somewhat related to the above, my dad wants me to start going to church, but I'm agnostic-atheist. I've been agnostic-atheist since sophomore year and I am content with my belief. My dad does not know that, he thinks I'm Christian. Thankfully he's smart enough to respect my beliefs and he said he'll always support me no matter my beliefs. That doesn't stop me from being afraid of telling him that I'm atheist though.

‚Ä¢ Politics: This is the one thing that is worrying me the most. Not gonna go too deep into it, all I'm gonna say is there's a demented tangerine in office butchering the government and making a laughing stock of the US. Sic semper tyrannis.

PHYSICAL HEALTH:

‚Ä¢ Temperature: I get extremely hot extremely easily. I get so hot that I refuse to wear pants and coats no matter the temp. I have a small room with 2 machines running, bad AC, and an old fan. Without that fan, in Fall, my room is nearly 100F¬∞, seriously, I checked. This causes me to sweat a lot thus making me smell bad and feel bad, which brings me to my next issue.

‚Ä¢ Showering: I try to shower at least twice a week, usually 3 times a week. I used to only be able to shower every other day, but I've been trying to shower more often. Remember, I can only shower if both of my parents aren't home. They can't just drive around either, they have to have a purpose for going out other than letting me shower. Since I don't wear underwear, am fat, and sweat a lot, it doesn't do as much as I'd hoped for. The clammy wet skin and coldness after showering also sucks.

‚Ä¢ Teeth: I can't brush my teeth. I haven't brushed my teeth in maybe half a year. I've had 2 or 3 cavities either removed or filled in the past few years. The only way I can kinda brush them is via a dry washcloth, which even then I don't do often. I can't deal with the gritty teeth, shitty flavor, and the inedible properties of toothpaste. Guess what? After finding a toothpaste that actually works, I still can't use it. I see videos of massive chunks of calculus being removed by dentists and the only think I can think of is ""that's gonna be me"". I primarily drink soda and milk, and I primarily eat potato chips, pizza, fast food, and vegan meat. This brings me to my next issue.

‚Ä¢ Obesity: I'm roughly 6 feet tall and weigh roughly 280 pounds at 17 years old, which makes me obese. Idgaf what others think of my weight, I don't think my obesity makes me ugly. I do think it makes me unhealthy though. I buy ice cream and fries at McDonald's at least once a week, often twice a week. I've tried quitting soda, tried quitting potato chips, and I've done neither. Sun Drop has been my favorite drink since I could walk. However, I've made a very big step that I am pretty proud of; I quit caffeine. Now I drink caffeine free Coke. Still extremely unhealthy, but hey, it's something. I also don't drink water, the only situation where I'd drink water is if I'm extremely thirsty and there's nothing else available. Extremely cold water is nice, but I can't get it extremely cold very fast. I don't eat much, usually 1 or 2 meals a day and sone snacks if I'm still hungry. Since I get so hot and exhausted, I don't exercise. I think eating meat is healthier than not eating meat, but I'm vegetarian.

‚Ä¢ Eyes: This has 2 parts to it; strain and sight. Given that I stare at a screen for like 10 hours a day, I often get eye strain and twitches. The former is a bad headache that makes me tired, the latter makes me want to rip my eyes out. My light is always off in my room and I usually have 2 screens on 24/7. I use blue light filter and dim the brightness, but still get strain and twitches. Although I eventually got used to it, the strain has been affecting me recently since I've been looking at my phone a lot more because I can't use my Playstation. Last night was the worst it's been, I could barely keep my eyes open and pretty much fell asleep as soon as I got home. Acetaminophen is hit or miss, ibuprofen doesn't work. Now onto sight. My left eye has a tendency to drift to the left (happening as I'm typing, weirdly makes it easier to see, can't remember the name for it), i have astigmatism (lights give off spiky glares), and i have trouble seeing far away. I have glasses but I don't use them. Tried contacts, but anything that touches my eyes immediately makes them shut tight. My sight isn't that bad, just makes me sad when I can't see Kahoot answers lol.

‚Ä¢ Neck: Looking down at my MacBook and phone all day puts a lot of strain on the back of my neck. Not too bad, but definitely makes my neck achy, hurts in the evening.

‚Ä¢ Nausea: Since I've been more anxious recently, my stomach has been more sensitive than usual and it's ached more than usual. I drink a lot of milk too and I'm lactose-intolerant, it's too good not to drink. I usually don't have bathroom issues though, so that's nice. Combined with eye strain it feels like torture. 

‚Ä¢ Hand Washing: I will only wash my hands if I get something sticky/slimy on them, I'm about to prepare food in culinary class, or during a shower. No, I do not wash them after wiping my ass (assuming I don't get shit on them). I try to use hand sanitizer as much as I can, but I often forget. 

There's probably more to the health section, but let's move on.

FINANCES:

Food and household stuff? 100$ a week. Gas? Idk, but probably quite a bit. Bills? Don't ask. Medicine? $200 a month. Subscriptions? An embarrassing amount. It may not seem like a lot, but my parents combined make roughly $50k and live paycheck to paycheck. Even with my mom getting a second job we struggle. We still have to file an insurance claim on our driveway because Hurricane Helene turned the bottom of it into a rally track. No way I'm getting a job soon, there's way too much on my plate already.

COLLEGE:

Jfc. I have to fill out scholarships, keep up with FAFSA, file for housing, go to the open house, schedule a tour, buy essentials, qualify for a solo dorm (I can't have a roommate under any circumstances), and i need to get thousands of dollars, all with the very real chance that I'll fail, drop out, or deal with even more anxiety when I'm in college. I'm scared of being independent. Without saying my goal, it can take several years to be qualified enough to work at my dream job, and will cost tens of thousands of dollars with the ONLY opportunity to pass. 

DOGS:

I have 2 very cute dogs; Bandit and Cedar. They're both collies, brother and sister, and I love them dearly. However, everytime I hear them bark, everytime I see them vomit, everytime I smell shit, I lose a small bit of the little sanity I have left. Cedars bark specifically has made me walk 2 football fields away from my house, and I could still vaguely hear it. Like I said, I love my dogs, but I'll be damned if I EVER get another dog again

No human has the ability to handle all of this at once without freaking tf out. I go to school, come back home exhausted, take my meds, shower if I can, go in my hot dark room, turn on the same youtube playlist I've been watching for weeks, eat vegan meat, play Hollow Knight if I could use my Playstation, scroll through Reddit, lose hope after seeing a news article about Trump, listen to music, and try to go to sleep, all while worrying about the future, trying to cope with my mental health, and getting more and more unhealthy as the day goes by.

Sorry for the extremely long post, I just had to put everything that causes me stress into a single post to get my head straight.

TL;DR: Everything is terrible.

1jbla8j,In need of advice,MentalHealthSupport,1742006250.0,3,3,"Tonight is especially rough for me, and for a good reason, so i would really like to hear any advice you have for me, anything at all .
I listened to a song i havent heard for 4/5 years, its a song i listened to during the absolute worst time of my life, where deep depression and suicidal thoughts have completely eaten me whole . As someone who used to struggle with depression, my own ‚Äò death ‚Äò has no meaning anymore, since ive looked death right in its eyes . 
So back to the song, i have a pretty bad memory due to trauma, so just suddenly remembering the absolute desperation, loneliness and depression i felt all at once just somehow reminded me how that never changed, i just learned how to live with it, and with myself for being that way .
I have to do things on daily basis just to keep myself in check / to not ever go back to that stage .
If you are someone who has been through depression, self harm or suicidal attempt/ thoughts, how are you today ? and what keeps you to go forward and never look back into deaths eyes again ?
Thank you for reading this .",no reason to live
1jg4sgg,Truly Struggling,MentalHealthSupport,1742518624.0,2,3,"I‚Äôve struggled for as long as I can remember with anxiety and over thinking. I lost my mother to suicide when I was 14 but I still think I was an anxious being way before that. As of late, I am really struggling and I just feel like every day is a new giant challenge just to get over. I am 22 and just graduated college this past December and started a job in early February that has brought me a lot of stress and questions about what I want to do with my career. I know it‚Äôs early and normal to not know and to just be patient, but none of this advice helps me in the moment. 

I separated with my boyfriend last September as well after two years and we lived together so that was messy. In the last year I‚Äôve gained about 30 pounds. I felt tired, hopeless, sad, exhausted, and just burnt out and lost all the time. I don‚Äôt feel like there is hope for a better future or that I can lose weight and feel confident in my body again. I‚Äôve started dating someone new about 2 months ago and it‚Äôs been really good I just struggle a lot with feeling like he‚Äôs constantly mad at me. I express this to him and there‚Äôs no reason to feel that way, it‚Äôs just my anxiety. I don‚Äôt like to turn to him for all my troubles. Especially cause we are so new. 

I‚Äôve tried Prozac, Wellbutrin, sleeping meds, etc. I‚Äôm currently taking phentermine to help me lose weight. I really just don‚Äôt know what to do to make life better. I feel as if i want to sleep and not wake up. all i want to do is hide in my bed from all my issues and never face anything. im tired of feeling so down and exhausted all of the time.

1jr2z6x,I don‚Äôt think my family will survive this mental health crisis. Help?,MentalHealthSupport,1743739321.0,0,1,"So to start, I have written this post out numerous times. I write it out, download Reddit, paste it in whatever community I can find (I never use Reddit, so I don‚Äôt really know how all of it works. If I need to post in another community or you suggest a different one please let me know), then I erase it before I hit post. I think after venting about it, even to no one, I feel a little better and go back to doing what I know best: avoiding the problem. I‚Äôm posting this time around because I can‚Äôt keep this up. Im riddled with guilt everyday, depressed, anxious, overwhelmed. Nobody in my family seems to care besides me and my grandma, but shes getting too old to be any help and she‚Äôs kinda crazy too. Long story short, my mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2020. Around this time, I was in nursing school which I had to drop out to take care of her and due to my own mental health. I never went back. I cared for her for the first 2 years of her diagnosis. Took her to doctor‚Äôs appointments , all other appointments, drove her around town (trying to give her a sense of normalcy, we would go grocery shopping or get our nails done), got her everything she needed, cooked, cleaned, etc. I was her caretaker since nobody else seemed to care. My dad is in the picture but barely. I think he hates us, and I‚Äôll explain my dad in the best way I can: a verbally abusive alcoholic, narcissistic asshole, cares about money more than anything and has used money as a form of control since I was a child (my mom never worked, to which my dad held this over her head for the last 25 years always hearing ‚Äú you need to get a job, you don‚Äôt do shit around here‚Äù etc. always being shouted around the house. my mom always kept the house clean, did his laundry; did everything a wife was supposed to do. My dad has always hated her. Even to this day, he calls her names and ridicules her despite what she is going through. I think he is the reason she turned out this way, and another reason because her daughter died suddenly when she was 5. (My step sister, she died before I was born). My dad won‚Äôt leave her because of money and my mom can‚Äôt leave him because she just isn‚Äôt mentally competent anymore. To describe my mom is hard.. I love her to death but I also want to be honest about how all this affects me. And I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone but I really need someone to see me. My mom acts like a 7 year old that‚Äôs also a broken record. I haven‚Äôt had an intelligent interaction / convo with her in over 5 years. Even before it wasn‚Äôt much better, as she numbed herself with drugs and alcohol for the reminder of my childhood. I might go as far to say I‚Äôve never had a true, meaningful conversation with her, ever. Her drug of choice was vodka and Xanax (I‚Äôm sorry if this isn‚Äôt allowed but I think it‚Äôs important to the story) and she almost died a few times. Other times she almost died to suicide. She was in and out of mental hospitals when I was younger but it was all swept under the rug until 2020 when all hell broke loose. Her doctors say she went into psychosis, where she was completely detached from reality and my mom, who does not have a mean bone in her body, became violent and acted in ways like she was possessed. I actually need to go to therapy because I blocked most of this out, but when I asked about the broken mircowave my brother said she ripped the microwave out of the wall & threw it across the room. I mean, my god, you have to be pretty strong to do that right?

I also have 3 brothers, 2 younger and an older brother with Autism. Older brother is my dad‚Äôs ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù (dad‚Äôs words) I think because he‚Äôs, well, not all there ( again I‚Äôm not trying to offend anyone but please just think about it - all his kids hate him except the one who is legally a child dependent on him forever, and so easily susceptible to manipulation. he does anything my dad says. Including bully my mom.) we hate him because he has brainwashed and bullied us all of our lives. We have been manipulated for so long to sell this lie of the ‚Äúperfect family‚Äù that never existed in the first place. We live in a small town and grew up around our extended family. They know my dad is an asshole, but I don‚Äôt think they know what he‚Äôs done. Last Christmas, the family get together was so weird and strange . My mom is like this huge elephant in the room, everyone kind of tip toes around the fact that she acts so different now, not avoiding her but at the same time, not engaging with her at all. Almost like they were alienating us, I can‚Äôt think of a better way to describe it. It‚Äôs not like they were blatantly doing it but like they were all talking and having a good time WITH EACH OTHER, meanwhile we all awkwardly stand to the side. Not literally, but at the same time literally. I feel like I‚Äôm probably confusing you further but this is how it is inside of the ‚Äúfamily‚Äù, you feel these slight little jabs but they are so slight that you can‚Äôt really raise a problem about them, bc everyone is so nice with words or actions the majority of the time. So it confuses you. And makes you feel crazy for picking up on anything at all, because what is the point if you can‚Äôt say anything? I don‚Äôt know what else to say about them, besides they all dance around it because it‚Äôs not their problem, basically. But I want to scream to them ‚ÄúTHIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM AND WE ARE ALL DYING!‚Äù

If I didn‚Äôt mention it, I am married. I got married 4 months ago to the most amazing man that has saved me more than he knows. I have spilled all of this to him before and as many times as we have talked about it together, we can‚Äôt come up with any solutions. Most of our conversations end with ‚Äúyeah, I don‚Äôt know‚Äù or the classic ‚Äúwell, what do you do.‚Äù We‚Äôve basically come to the conclusion that we can‚Äôt control what other people do so it‚Äôs best to just avoid, or cut out the toxicity in your life. So when we got married, that‚Äôs what I did. Since the new year, I have only been over to that house twice. Once for my birthday and then again for Valentine‚Äôs Day. My husband suggested I cut them off because they were killing me, he said that every time I came over after being there I looked dead or like the ‚Äúlife had been sucked out of me‚Äù and it was true. I don‚Äôt know how else to explain it. Not only my mom, dad, but my brothers sucked the life out of me everyday. So he hit the nail on the head with that one. But the only thing is, now 4 months later, I don‚Äôt have the heart to block my mom. I still answer her calls sometimes. None of this is her fault and I feel guilty but she has problems that are beyond me (and as much as I‚Äôve tried to help her the doctors would never listen to me and my grandma made this difficult too in her own ways but that is a whole other story). There‚Äôs so many levels to this I feel liked id never be able to explain it all in detail, but basically my mom has been declining rapidly since her diagnosis. I don‚Äôt recognize her anymore, even physically. She doesn‚Äôt look out of her eyes the same she almost stares straight through you. I saw a glimpse of her on Easter last year but it went away just as fast as it came. There are days where I hate my mom, where I wish death on her, and then I feel bad about it. I am NEVER mean to my mother to her face, aside from my teen years, because she doesn‚Äôt deserve it. I just let her be, take it as best I can, and then scream about it later to myself or to my husband. I think she might have dementia the way that she repeats herself often or asks the same questions over and over. The doctors just say she has schizophrenia bc she is only 55. I stopped trying to get through to her, like I really believe that my mom is long gone and that I‚Äôll never see her again. I feel like she is already dead except I still get non-stop texts from her all day, everyday, I mean like they never stop. (I have her muted, but haven‚Äôt brought myself to block her) Calls come every hour on the hour. I got a message once that my iPhone storage was full, come to find my messages are taking up all storage on my phone. I delete my mom‚Äôs texts because duh, and it crashed my phone. When it came to, 55,000 text messages sat in my recently deleted. My phone crashed again when I deleted it from that folder. The thing is I always tried to text her at least once a day, but there have been days even weeks where I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to text her at all. And it really doesn‚Äôt matter because Nothing stops her sporadic and incessant messages. I kind of just gave up because I ain‚Äôt reading all that. I decided to include some of these messages here. she will still repeat herself 100s of times. I‚Äôve told her that, how text messages works, is that they are always there for me to see. so if I don‚Äôt reply, then I will still see the message and reply when I can. She will basically send the same thing over and over again until I answer. It‚Äôs harassing and overwhelming, I get sick thinking about what she writes. Sometimes when I take a peek, I‚Äôm filled with dread at the things she says
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to be here much longer‚Äù, 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm the only mom you are ever going to have‚Äù 
‚Äúplease  come see me‚Äú 
‚Äúare you coming?‚Äù 
‚ÄúPlease come‚Äù ‚Äú
‚Äúcome‚Äù 
‚ÄúDads mean to me‚Äù
‚Äúare you coming‚Äù 
‚Äúcome today or tomorrow‚Äù 
‚Äúplease are you coming?‚Äù  

Guilt trip after guilt trip, and constantly begging me to come see her. She tells people I don‚Äôt come see her and then everyone makes me out to be the bad guy. She also writes these letters to me and my husband Every. Single. Day. I have deleted the majority of her text messages. But I will include some from within the last month

I am begging for even a light at the end of the tunnel, because even though I am out of it I have still not escaped and I don‚Äôt know if I ever will. My father in law tells me stories about how he relates, as his dad has dementia and treated him terribly. But then again, he is 50 something and I am 27. His dad is 80, my mom is 55. To me, it doesn‚Äôt seem relatable because  I have just began my own life, trying to anyway with my new husband and navigating this as a young adult. Most people my age don‚Äôt have to worry about their parents. I‚Äôve had to raise mine even to this day. My dad does nothing but work, drink, and abuse everyone in the house. He acts like such a victim saying things like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt handle this anymore, your mom is insane‚Äù or crying about the next thing. He is a terrible human being in my opinion, a mean old nasty drunk who is good for nothing except for his money. (Did I mention he is a millionaire? And he still won‚Äôt get my mom the help she needs?) CAN I SUE MY FUCKING DAD AT THIS POINT?? 

I think I‚Äôll end it here ‚Äî please let me know if I need to elaborate or give more to the story but I don‚Äôt want to keep rambling. I feel like I explained the most important parts and how I keep getting sucked back into their world. Whether it‚Äôs my own guilt eating me alive or something else, idk if I can keep on doing this but I don‚Äôt know what else to do. Is avoiding it stupid? Or is going back over there stupid? Do I have to do anything at all? (I know the answer is probably no, but it‚Äôs not so black and white , I think about my mom, mentally ill deserving of the proper care and instead still getting abused day in and day out.) Who do you call for stuff like this ? The police has never helped, doctors don‚Äôt help, I‚Äôve even had a bad experience with a lawyer. (Claimed we needed all of my father‚Äôs assets to qualify for divorce, and surprise, he would not give them to us. lol) the lawyer refused to help us further, even after hearing her story. I think I‚Äôm at my wits end, I have exhausted all efforts to the best of my abilities. 

TLDR: my mom is schizophrenic and still getting abused by my dad. I am finally out of the house and married trying to start my own life but feel like I keep getting sucked back in. I am getting eaten alive with guilt but don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. ",no reason to live
1jiloha,It feels like we are falling apart..,MentalHealthSupport,1742803701.0,0,1,"I am 17 years old ‚Äî a boy trapped in a cycle of self-destruction.
I procrastinate, I watch porn, I vape, I carve my pain into my skin.
For five years, I have been nothing but a ghost.
Now, I have no friends.
Not one.
My family, lost in their own vices, drowns out my presence.
Often, I just want to disappear forever.

She is 18.
A girl with a heart too big for this world.
She calls herself a people pleaser.
Unfortunately she gives until there‚Äôs nothing left of her.
Life never made things easy.
People used her, betrayed her, left scars too deep to fade.
She‚Äôs lost good friends, suffered panic attacks that steal the air from her lungs.
She believes she doesn‚Äôt deserve food, doesn‚Äôt deserve care.
She cuts herself.
She has tried to die ‚Äî more than once.

And yet, somehow, we found each other.

It started three months ago.

That night, I tried to end my life.
But morning came, and I was still here.
So I wrote.
Poured my pain into a Reddit post, hoping someone, anyone, would hear me.
No one did.

Until her.

She sent a message.
Told me she was sorry.
That I deserved more.
Gave me words I never knew I needed.
I thanked her, thinking that was the end of it.

But the next day, she asked if I had eaten.
If I had drunk enough water.
(At the time, I barely ate at all.)
I answered.
Then I answered again.
And again.
And again.

Soon, we spoke every day.
Hours passing like seconds.
We unraveled everything‚Äîour pasts, our fears, our dreams, the pieces of ourselves we never dared to show the world.
There was no judgment.
No shame.
Only understanding.

Weeks passed before we understood.

One evening, I bought flowers, took a picture, and told her she meant the world to me.
She was quiet at first.
Then, she told me she loved me.
A moment later, I said it back.
It felt so right.

We grew closer.
Every whispered ‚ÄûI love you,‚Äù every ‚ÄûI wish I could hold you‚Äù, every ‚ÄûI want to fall asleep beside you and wake up to your warmth‚Äù pulled us deeper into something neither of us had ever known.
For both of us it's the first relationship.

And then came desire.

The thought of her ignited something inside me.
A longing.
To touch.
Neither of us has ever known intimacy, but if we were together, we would.
Slowly. Gently. Desperately.
Not just for the act itself, but for the connection, the feeling of being real in each other‚Äôs arms.
She wants that.
I want that.
We developed passionate fantasies together.
She tells me she would give herself to me completely.
She says it over and over.

But the world is cruel.
We are over six thousand kilometers apart.
Don't speak the same language.
Our English is bad.
It leaves no room for calls, for video, for more than just words on a screen.
We are trapped in distance, in silence.
And it is unbearable.
I'm also scared of direct contact.
It's so complicated.

She loves me with every piece of herself.
I know that.
But I cannot let her cling to a shadow she will never touch.
And yet, she won‚Äôt let go.
‚ÄûAnything for you.‚Äù

I am still that same lost boy, drowning in my own darkness.
I am immature.
I am not a good person.
Not even close.
And yet, I make her happy.
I don‚Äôt understand why, but I do.

I can‚Äôt even maintain a normal friendship.
How could I ever hold onto love?
All the dreams we share ‚Äî I know they will never become reality.
And it crushes me.
It makes me want to scream.

I don‚Äôt want to lose her.
She is my first love.
My only love.
The deepest connection I have ever known.
But I feel us slipping.

If I walk away, I fear she won‚Äôt survive it.
And I cannot bear that weight.

But if we stay, this pain will only grow.
I know that, too.

What am I supposed to do?
What the hell am I supposed to do?

I don‚Äôt want to let her go.
Because if I do, I will never find someone like her again.

1iy5ntp,physically and mentally exhausted,MentalHealthSupport,1740517144.0,0,1,"I find life unbearably exhausting. The only time I can truly replenish myself is when I‚Äôm alone and sleeping. Anything other than alone time can not be used as time to recalibrate. 

I deeply long for some sort of relief from this exhaustion. My sleep is really bad. I wake up 6-8 times per night, night sweats, nightmares, needing the toilet, anything really, I can sleep long hours but the quality is terrible. 

I work flexibly but full time remotely. It‚Äôs a simple call center job with no strings attached but I‚Äôm a creative individual so my heart is within my other projects, and I feel burnt out just having to work these unstimulating jobs . Basically most things burn me out at the moment unless they are directly nourishing or things that I choose to do for myself, not obligations for others or obligations for me. 
I‚Äôm getting my bloods done tomorrow, but I‚Äôm not sure what else, I think I‚Äôm going to give up smoking, I‚Äôve tried before but I think the best method is snus for now. 
I‚Äôm going to try and sleep as much as possible. Because I‚Äôm so fatigued I‚Äôm finding it hard to excercise but even if I can do a little movement. There are several things that are important right now so it‚Äôs hard to prioritise especially with little energy. 1. I‚Äôm redrafting a play i wrote. 2. I‚Äôm learning a new course which I‚Äôm really interested in. 3. I enjoy digital art and find it therapeutic - these things are important to me and aid my wellbeing as they support my purpose, but obviously I can‚Äôt do all these things in an evening. 

I know truly to heal I have to stop working for a bit but I‚Äôm travelling next month with my partner and need to be able to afford living and saving up. 

I‚Äôve had a few severe mental health episodes in my life, and they‚Äôve sort of ended with me not being able to work and bed ridden for months at a time. But I‚Äôm kind of forced and encouraged by family to be working up until the point of physical inability. I‚Äôm so scared of getting to that point again as I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll make it back out. 

I have such high expectations for myself, but tend to have issues with priorities. So for example in order to provide stimulation for myself by immersing in my rewarding hobbies, simple stuff like tidying, laundry, cooking get abandoned.

1ip7zuy,"Keep externalizing my feelings through conversation, pressuring/ burdening others. Any tips on how to deal with my emotions better?",MentalHealthSupport,1739530275.0,0,1,"Hi there!
This is the first time I ever post anything on Reddit, so sorry if it seems a bit messy. 

For background purposes:
I have gone multiple circles over the last couple years finding a friend circle, establishing myself and finding meaningful connections to me, followed by these circles falling apart/ ejecting me/ me ejecting myself  in on way or another over the last couple of years. While there were of course outside factors contributing and people also didn‚Äôt always treat me fairly, me being the common factor has made me try to be more aware of what behaviors/habits I exhibit, that increase the likelihood or even specifically create these situations. They hurt me immensely and I want nothing less than to hurt or burden others through my behavior and I feel I need to figure out how to actually change things inside of me to improve how my life is going, but I don‚Äôt even know where to start, it feels impossible many days to ever change. 

What I have observed that I think creates the biggest issues:

1. I feel emotions incredibly intensely (from observation way more than others) unwillingly being/seeming dramatic to others.

2. Because these emotions feel so intense, they often seem unbearable, needing release. 9/10 times, the only thing that feels like it could help, is talking to others, explaining the feelings to them and depending on the case, finding sympathy and reassurance for the validity of them. I in no way have any intentions in that direction, but this seems to burden friends a lot, as it happens rather often (especially in times of crisis of course) and in some senses I think, by this being my only outlet, I unwittingly make people responsible/ feel responsible for my emotional wellbeing. 

3. This entire thing of feeling so intensely and rarely ever managing more than 10minutes without finding that outlet, also leads to me being a person that is complaining about things constantly, rather than keeping a positive outlook. I feel like this additionally burdens those close to me, as they have to listen to me complain a lot. 

4. When people inevitably interact less with me, whether that be just the natural thing that happens of sometimes spending more and sometimes less time with certain friends, or them actively leaving, because of the aforementioned pressure/ burden, I deal with intense feelings of being left behind/ not good enough/ abandoned. I have tried to be aware of that and brace myself, as to not act in ways unfair to others, but I still often end up getting clingy/pushy in kind of a panicked attempt to hold on. I have identified potential causes for this in my past, as well as the fact I don‚Äôt have others to fall back on, when that ‚Äòprimary friend group‚Äô leaves or spends less time with me. This of course weighs on their mental health and also pushes them away more, leaving me having felt justified in the fear of abandonment and that increasing, causing it to be even harder to avoid this behavior. 

So basically I cannot handle a friendship developing into a less active attachment. It feels very all or nothing in my head and no matter how much I know it isn‚Äôt, and try to reason with myself logically, the feelings never truly leaves. 

Sorry for the long text block, I just want to be honest about the behaviors and see if anyone experiences something similar, or maybe even the other side of this. 
Does anyone have tips and pointers for me, how I can better regulate my emotions and where to start on implementing a different outlet for myself, so I don‚Äôt burden others so much? (Both the potential type of outlet and how to get it to feel helpful and for me to reach for it in those panicked states)
Any other thoughts, tips, etc. are also welcome of course!
Thanks for anyone who took the time to read and maybe even help me improve to be a better person!",life is unbearable
1iluwuv,How do I recover from this shutdown?,MentalHealthSupport,1739151585.0,0,1,"Hello, fellow redditors. I (25M) have been suffering from mental health issues (anxiety/depression) my entire life. However, since November my mental health has been on a downhill trend. The past couple weeks have been bad, but this weekend in particular has been nearly unbearable.

I feel I've lost all passion for life and everything. I don't have any energy and have become isolated since graduating college four years ago. I feel the flame inside me has died out and I don't know how to reignite it.

What exacerbated the depression has been the prospect of a new job. I've been searching for a new job since November, and recently found one that I'd normally be excited for. It pays three times my current salary and is in a field that has always piqued my interest. Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case.

I've worked in my current role for three years and have been spoiled with too much flexibility. My current employer, a small weekly newspaper, is very small ‚Äî there's only four of us in the office, and only one who comes in on a daily basis for mornings. I've unfortunately lost rhythm and have worked less and less. (I'm supposed to be full time, but on average only logged 35ish hours a week. Since November I've been down to as few as 20-25 hours a week, not counting the weeks where I completely shut down and couldn't work at all.) I've been burned out on journalism before, and was hoping to find a basic ""bridge"" job till I could find something more permanent out. Complicating matters is my cannabis addiction, which I've been working on trying to curb. (I quit for a couple weeks for the pre-employment UA at this new job but unfortunately relapsed afterward. I haven't even heard the results yet.)

Thus, I've been extremely apprehensive about the new job ‚Äî writing for a utility company. On one hand, I'd be financially set. On the other hand, it's a big transition (working 8 a.m.-4:30 p.m. five days a week out of their office, not to mention getting adjusted to the content they write) and I don't have the passion for it. Despite being up my usual alley, I just haven't been able to muster any excitement for the new position. It's been nothing but worry and fear about failing at the job. The passion isn't there, at least not now, for journalism.

But I haven't felt passionate about ***anything***. Usual interests and hobbies haven't piqued my interest. I haven't felt like doing anything. As I write this, I don't even know how I'll be able to go into work tomorrow since I literally feel like lying in bed all day. However, as I lay there (or ""watch"" TV), I just ruminate about this job, other alternatives (I have no idea what else to do with my life), and things beyond my control. (I feel a big part of my mental health decline has been caused by ongoing political turbulence here in the United States.)

There has been some passive suicidal ideation. Nothing serious, but mainly just wanting to go to sleep and not wake up. Part of me feels like the only way out of this situation is death, but I also know that mental health is cyclical and this is just a ""pit"" of despair I'll eventually get out of.

How can I ""wake up"" and reignite my passion for living, and hopefully get my passion for journalism back? How can I stop the ruminating? How can I get the energy/willpower to ""force"" myself back into the world to get my life back on track? I could go on, but I just want some relief from this depression and hope that things will improve eventually. I've tried some breathing/relaxation techniques the local behavioral health crisis center suggested today, but they only work for a little bit before the ruminating starts back up.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the short novel, and thanks in advance.",life is unbearable
1ia6avq,im scared im self sabotaging myself without realizing it,MentalHealthSupport,1737867293.0,1,1,"m, 17. lol. ive always found myself feeling somewhat lonely my whole life, even if im around family or friends that i love dearly. ive never payed attention to it because it goes away the second im laughing crying at something with people. ive developed new friendships this past two years and i think theyre the best friends i can ever ask for. i mean, one of them joined my band. but as of recently ive been getting pretty down, ive got an anxiety disorder ive developed from early childhood trauma that makes me constantly paranoid that any minute im not doing anything is a minute wasted i could‚Äôve spent spending time with friends and family. its something that is constantly on my mind at every given moment. when im with family, i get anxious thinking about friends so i cant fully enjoy being with family, and or vice versa. recently my anxiety has been getting worse, because funny enough the only thing i feel i have the energy to do is nothing. i havent been going to school, im unemployed and ive just been smoking and sleeping all day. its making me feel so fucking awful, like im waisting my life away. this is where the stupid part comes in. all of what im about to describe has developed only recently, as of this past couple months. im too cowardly to talk to my friends. i know they care and want to hear from me if im sad but its like a switch flipped where i feel like they dont‚Ä¶ really care‚Ä¶. i know they do like i KNOW they do, because they tell me they do. but theres something in my head that makes me cant believe they care, or at least not enough. or theres some sign im waiting for to convince me they do that im not seeing from them. i dont want to think that they arent doing enough to support me because i know they do. it just feels that way and i feel horribly guilty and almost selfish about it. today i got super glum and down because im scared im pushing my friends away or that i could be closer with them. i havent had a solid close friend my whole life, so when i got these guys, it grew a paranoia of having to monitor or keep things in order so that they dont like.. get bored of me and find people to replace me‚Ä¶ if that makes sense. my two friends have been friends with eachother for years before they met me, and i envy their relationship. i guess thats kinda why i feel so bad. i crave what they have. its authentic and consistent and theyre there for eachother, not that they aren‚Äôt for me, but i wish i had an ultimate close friend like how they are. but i cant just tell them that‚Ä¶ ‚Äúhey im sad and depressed that you two have a beautiful friendship i dont have‚Äù like i feel STUPID. today i got all glum about it while with them and i eventually shut down. i didnt talk for about an hour and ended up locking myself in the bathroom for an hour crying, to then messaging them both profusely apologizing. i feel embarrassed and guilty. i feel like they might see me as an attention seeker, and i definitely feel like i am. i cant talk to them so i bottle it up until i get overwhelmed and shut down so that its now obvious im sad and they gotta address it because im not gunna be the first to reach out. i cant control it but i know its unbearable for them both. i feel like such a horrible person. and then im now the center of attention because im being an emo ungrateful little shit. and i hate that. for them and for myself. but it feels like some big huge rain cloud that has accumulated over the course of months finally just starts raining. and im just a silent sack of sad. and im a person who HATES people knowing about my mental health. its a big thing im dealing with in my life but i dont want people knowing because i dont want it to be my defying quality. im more than my anxiety. i paint and make music and stuff and i want people to see that before my anxiety and possible depression. and i cant really pull that off well if im having mental breakdowns all the time. i just feel super alone and dramatic, like im only ever in my head. one side of my head thinks its the end of the world and that everyone hates me and the other is telling myself im a dramatic hormonal teenager. im just so exhausted and torn. i want someone to hear me rant like this and care. with all their heart. i know its alot to ask but its what i crave. i have a therapist i talk to about all of this, and i appreciate him because he has helped me throughout the years of seeing him but i feel i should he saying this to someone who knows me personally and WANTS to hear about this. i dont rant to my friends or talk to them randomly when we‚Äôre not together because i just feel weird about it like it wont matter to them or something.. but they‚Äôre MY FRIENDS. and i know they‚Äôd support me if i told them all of this, but i just get that petrified feeling of like‚Ä¶ what if its not that big of a deal to them than it is me. its all stupid and doesnt make sense in my head.. i just feel pathetic and lonely. i just always feel super insecure in every situation im in, like theres something deeper i don‚Äôt understand but that its also my responsibility to figure it out, solve it, and apologize for it. i feel weird bringing this up to my friends because i feel like in their point of view, id be weird and possessive and dramatic. and i guess i am. i just want consistent companionship. so. fucking. bad. im terrified this is gunna get worse and that ill cut myself off from everyone and be alone forever. my anxiety is so fucking awful that typing this makes me feel like maybe it was all in my head and that physically typing it out is locking the situation into existence and now it‚Äôll actually happen. i just feel super alone :/ id love any and all advice or support. i know this was super emo and i apologize ",life is unbearable
1ifysv0,My bully saw me admitting myself to a psychiatric hospital today,MentalHealthSupport,1738507822.0,0,1,"I  was severely bullied in high school. It wasn‚Äôt just the typical school drama, it was relentless, humiliating, and left scars that ran deep. As a trauma response, I completely isolated myself right after graduating. I cut off everyone, not just my bullies but also those who stayed friends with them. I wanted nothing to do with anyone associated with that chapter of my life.

Fast forward to today. I hit a breaking point and needed immense help, so I begged my parents to take me to a psychiatric hospital. It was a hard decision, but I knew I had to do it for myself. But life? Life has a twisted sense of humor.

To my bad luck, my high school bully was there. At first, I thought she was admitting herself, but no‚Äîshe was just there with her grandmother. Still, the moment she saw me, she greeted me, and I responded coldly. And then? She had this look. This smug, satisfied look. She immediately pulled out her phone, typed something in her group chat, and kept glancing at me. I couldn‚Äôt see what she was saying, but I felt it. Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking, but given our history, I don‚Äôt think so.

This is the same girl who went around spreading lies about me, claiming I was ‚Äúcompeting‚Äù with her when I had long stopped paying attention. I never entertained her drama, and I never defended myself against her lies. And for years, she and her friends wondered why I disappeared, assuming it was because I was doing well. They even asked around about me, trying to pry. But now? Now they know the truth. Now they know I‚Äôm struggling, and I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that they enjoy knowing that.

I feel so ashamed and embarrassed. Life already feels unbearably heavy, and now this? I just wish, for once, things could go my way.",life is unbearable
1icnl1d,Having a rough time.,MentalHealthSupport,1738131783.0,0,1,"I know this is very long but I would really appreciate y‚Äôall for reading this and helping a sister out with advice :)
So i have been feeling very anxious and depressed. I have been getting off a new medication this past month for my anxiety and depression that my psychiatrist recommended me because i told her it has been really hard to be present and feel myself. That i feel like i am constantly doing something or getting distracted to aboid really and therefore procrastinating and making my anxiety worse. So, i guess you can say its normal that i feel those effects of getting off it but damn, its kicking my ass. I feel so depressed, sad and anxious. I cant sleep properly, my body is tense i have no motivation, yet at the same time im happy that i am getting of the meds because even on them i didnt feel myself. I could barely cry or feel a thing. I was so mellow yet deeply anxious. It almost felt like a ticking time bomb of emotions and now they are hitting me hard. Also, for a bit of context, I am 21 years old and a junior at SDSU. I transferred after 3 years of community college and am continuing my marketing major at sdsu. I have realized i dont really care for marketing, its meh to me but when i was 18 i did not know what to do with my life but to move from Mexico with my parents to San Diego alone to get my studies. I mainly just wanted at the time to get out of my parents house because it was getting so toxic and i felt that studying was a viable option at least at the time. Now that i got into my ‚Äúdream school‚Äù i feel so much pressure to do something good and to have a great time being interested in my career and have these big goals yet, i feel lonelier than ever. I have a few select friends from my other school, some friends i have made from outside and not in campus and so i really have no one to talk to at school. Not to mention, I feel a great disconnect with the people (americans) because for me theres a huge culture shock so i feel discouraged to talk to anyone on campus and in classes. Did I mention I am depressed, this has made it encredibly hard for me to talk to anyone because i already don‚Äôt want to talk to them because there isnt going to be a connection, i feel try-hard, i recently hate everything and everyone, i am not doing my best and i am already in an even worse mood in a class i dont even care and is so long and boring. I literally dont talk to anyone and feel discouraged to talk to anyone. I feel so lonely at school but also at home. I dont have a job as I already think and feel that i would just not be able to deliver properly as i am fucking depressed and mentally exhausted. I feel the pressure of getting a job from my parents as I work because they also ask me about it, and i hate it because i feel like they dont understand how unbearable everything is right now for me and I can barely manage 5 classes plus a part time job. Also, i feel even more anxious because i usually take 4 classes a semester for my own sanity and i pushed myself to take 5-6 classes this semester becausse OTHERWISE i would feel like a failure mainly to my parents and because I dont think they want to pay for my brother and mine‚Äôs apartment another semester for me to graduate if i were to take 4 classes a semester. Safe to say I am very stressed, overwhelmed, unsatissfied, alone and super scared about the future. I have always struggled with anxiety and depression and most of my family and friends know this. I have a therapist and psychiatrist. However, I feel like I am constantly struggling and feel like a constant drag when i air this out to my friends and family and even to my therapist who ive been seeing for 3 years, but this feels really real and heavy to me. I am not having fun and losing hope. I truly feel so alone and don‚Äôt know what to do about all these things. I bet this might sound like I am exageratting or other people have it super hard but I really am very hopeless because of how much I am in pain right now and have been this past year. I cant focus on anything, my brain is tired and scattered and I feel like shit. I feel like I‚Äôve for a long time tried to do everything, get into clubs, more in person classes, get a job, go to therapy, get on medication, be more open, have a routine yet I still feel unsatissfied and depressed and anxious. Im also scared i wont pass any of my classes this semester bc of how i feel lol. Nvertheless, what i do know is that i just want to finish my career. Ive dedicated time and effort to it and i just would love to finish but i would love peace of mind, tranquility, connection and to know that everything will be okay and that life can be fun and joyful.  Everything just seems like so much on my mind and on my plate that i just need support and having anymore bigger changes is very hard for me to do because of my current state.
I also wanted to add about my therapist, she is a lovely lady and i have been seeing her for 4 years now but i dont feel as much support from her when it comes to guidance. She is amazing dont get me wrond, she listens and asks questions yet i need more guidance and coping skills for my stress. I feel like she doesnt provide that for me. Also, I only see her every 15 days because that what I can afford. ",life is unbearable
1i7nqpz,"If someone says something affectionate or tries to touch me while I'm eating, I feel sick. It's ruining my life.",MentalHealthSupport,1737584440.0,0,1,"Please, if you have any idea of why this is happening or if you have a suggestion that might help me, please, do.

It's hard to say with precision when this problem started. Officially, the first time I felt this way was about 5 years ago, but my psychologist believes it has been a problem for longer than that ‚Äî and that most likely, I reached my limit and started to feel the problem as intensely as possible, all that was missing was a trigger.

When I was 14 years old, I dated a girl during the pandemic. We didn't usually meet due to the circumstances and because of that, a part of our relationship was long distance. 3 months had gone by until we finally had the opportunity to see each other, I invited her to eat a burger at a relative's house and everything went well until the moment we sat down to eat. Everyone was sitting at the table and she was sitting next to me, I prepared my burger beforehand just the way I liked it to be done and I took the first bite. The feeling was immediate. I felt nauseous and dizzy, my body started to sweat and I felt that chill from when you lose something or someone important to you, it felt a lot like an anxiety attack, but it was much stronger. The last symptom was the urge to vomit, and I couldn't bear it. I ran to the bathroom and tried to calm myself down, and it was working until my girlfriend decided to check on me. As soon as she showed concern, it all came back. The situation was desperate. I was trying to relax, but her presence made it all come back and I had no idea what was happening. I think that I convinced her to leave me alone at that moment and I finally got to recover. The rest of the day felt like a blur, I felt exhausted and extremely weak without doing anything. I have never experienced anything like that in my entire life.

After that day, every time my girlfriend or someone from my daily life showed affection towards me, I felt the same way I felt that day. It was bearable in some way, but it turned out to be unbearable when someone tried to touch me. Any slight attempt to touch me felt like torture. When it happened, I felt paralyzed. I couldn't move a muscle, I was petrified with discomfort and I struggled to control my thoughts. Everything I mentioned, as I said, was tolerable, the worst part was the urge to puke. Both times it occured, I was in a relationship and those were the worst days of my life. All it takes is words of affection or an attempt to touch me and I get triggered, my body responds instantly. Even when I'm distracted and free of worries, my body responds the same way. Vomiting has always been the ""highest stage"" of this reaction, and it is the moment I completely lose control of my mind and mind. I always think I'm going to die and it's exhausting to live like this. Within the relationship, I was never able to be alone with her again, always scared by the thought of being touched and feeling sick because of it. The only moment I felt safe around her, was when we were surrounded by other people. I was sure she wouldn't touch me without permission or in a more ""direct way"".

It is important to make it clear that she was NEVER invasive and that she always RESPECTED my boundaries, these thoughts only went thought my head as a way of trying to explain what was happening to me. We broke up later and remained as friends. The interesting part is that the issue suddenly disappeared, just like magic. Of course, sometimes I felt sick because I wasn't completely free of it, but it wasn't nearly as intense as before.

Over the years, I learned to live with it. I avoided hugs, always said ""I love you"" before the person had the opportunity to say it first, ran away from family gatherings and adopted the image of a cold person to protect myself from any display of love and affection. It was tolerable for some time. Just like a virus, the issue began to ""mutate"" and affect even more areas of my life as the months gone by. Sometimes I had to stop talking to my friends and ask them for some time alone, because I couldn't stand the discomfort and the sickness. I could only stand the feeling when I was with my friend group and strangers, what was really bad was when my family and love interests were affectionately towards me. It was simply unbearable. I went to 4 psychologists before finding my current one, none of them paying attention to this dilemma. I went to my current psychologist only with the intention of resolving this issue, because it was staring to become difficult to live with such a problem. I made a lot of progress and I started to notice a few things. Whenever I felt bad, I was close to food. The first time it happened, I was eating, and every occurrence after that: I was eating, had just eaten, or was near food. If someone says something affectionate while I'm eating, I feel sick. It doesn't necessarily have to be an ""I love you"" or ""you're beautiful"", but what I understand as affection, which even involves jokes to make me laugh. As I said before, all of this is tolerable when it doesn't get out of hand, but when it affects my life to the point I can barely eat without feeling sick, it has become an urgency.

A long time ago, I changed several habits of mine because if it, such as having lunch with my family, being touched by my girlfriend when I'm eating, having snacks with friends and, most recently, I started to skip lunch. Somehow, the issue ended up affecting even things that don't directly envolve affection or being touched. Just the thought of lunch being an activity known for bringing a family together is enough to make me feel sick. Any conception and construction I have about what love is, and how it can be expressed, is enough to mess up my life. With some people, it's even harder to control, especially because of the proximity we share, but mainly because of the trust issues. The first thought that comes to my mind is: ""if I ask this person to stop, will they respect my decision?"". I built a hierarchy of trust in my head, from the most complicated to the simplest to deal with: love interests, family, friends and strangers. The funny thing is, how come my mind thinks a stranger is more trustworthy than a partner?

Because of this idea, my psychologist suggested that I might have suffered some kind of abuse during childhood. Not necessarily sexual violence, but a ""simple"" psychological abuse while I was eating, which expands the range of hypotheses. For example, I may have heard someone swearing at me during lunch and it created a trauma. The bif issue is that I don't remember basically anything from my childhood, not even my traumas. These days, I've been having some trouble swallowing pills and dealing with strong emotions, always around food. I don't know what to do or what to think about it anymore, I just want to be free from this issue and go back to living normally.",life is unbearable

1i45se0,I can't motivate myself anymore...,MentalHealthSupport,1737200359.0,0,1,"Hi, so I've been trying for a while now to figure a way out of my mental state, but I feel like it's just been getting worse.  
Here's to my situation:

I'm a 20F who grew up in an abusive household my entire life. Despite this, I was always an A-grade student and got told a great future laid ahead of me, that I would study something at uni that would get me a job with good money later on. It was the hope I clung onto.  
During Corona, the situation got worse. I probably don't have to tell you that those times were especially difficult for people who live in toxic homes. My sleeping schedule got messed up to the point where it hasn't been fixed until today, I spent most of my time just playing video games on my PC and felt a general decline in health.  
When I finally graduated, I was thrilled to apply for uni and finally get out. Turns out: Although university in general is free in my country, all the studies I was interested in were only provided by private unis. So I needed a lot of cash. That I didn't have.  
The grades I worked so hard for didn't matter.  
Great. Just great.

  
Meanwhile, the situation at home just got more and more unbearable each day. I just wanted to get out.

  
I tried to do so through scholarships. Failed. Realized I can't even get school done anymore with how bad it's gotten. Needed to find another way out.

Thankfully, my BF and his family are wonderful people who helped me basically flee from my childhood home over night. I moved in with him (we lived in different countries, so I immigrated) as he could provide for us as the only income.  
(I know, generally considered bad decision, but believe me, it got so bad at home that it turned into the better option. Never regretted it.)

It should have been the turning point for my mental health, right? Wrong.

I tried finding a job. Turns out English gets me nowhere in one of the best English speaking countries in the world.  
So, I need to study the language. Did good at first, but motivating myself got harder and harder over time.  
Decided half a year ago to study at home. Barely did. Can't bring myself to do it.  
Tried to at least be efficient at home, cleaning. Turned more and more exhausting. Feels like it became an enemy.

That's my general state at the moment. Just tired and exhausted. I slept 10 hours today and still feel this way. I've tried fixing my sleeping schedule over and over again, it just won't work.

I feel like I've reached my breaking point. There is no more motivation. What was laid out to be my initial path in life turned out to be a lie. I tried to arrange myself with my new situation and can't manage. I just feel more and more like a failure.  
And the cherry on top? My BF lost his job recently, so we're now also struggling with money. And I feel even worse knowing I haven't provided anything yet.  
I wanted to learn the language and find a job in the matter of 6 months. It's now been 1.5 years.

Told my therapist all of this. Her response? ""You just have to force yourself and try harder.""  
Yeah, thanks for that. It's not like I haven't done exactly that my ENTIRE LIFE and got nowhere.  
  
You might have already figured: I'm angry. I'm angry and frustrated that all my efforts amount to nothing. I put so much work into things just to have life respond by spitting me in the face. It drained my mental health so much that I now feel incapacitated even when it comes to simple tasks like just taking a shower.  
I'm so sick of it. Sick of life.

1if8qmy,ADHD daughter self harming - Advice?,MentalHealthSupport,1738423859.0,25,10,"Hi, all. My daughter is 12yo and we recently found out that she has been experimenting with cutting. To my knowledge, she has done it twice. It looks like cat scratches all over her arm and I am desperate to know how to help. 

She was diagnosed with ADHD in the third grade. I would say that she has the typical presentation for a girl - not hyperactive, but inattentive. She struggles to pay attention in school, but she has always done OK academically. She has always had friends, but has dealt with some social anxiety. We never medicated her ADHD because she always seemed to be doing OK. 

Fast forward to this year‚Ä¶. She is in 7th grade and this year has been so, so tough. She started pulling her hair out in the fall and we got her into therapy. She never connected with that therapist and she wanted to stop going after about five weeks, so we let her. Honestly she seemed to be doing better. Now I see that was a mistake. She recently experienced her first breakup and has been really hurt; this has been the reason she started cutting.

I have read about the correlation between ADHD and self harm behaviors and I certainly see a lot of these characteristics in her. She definitely has an intrinsic, compulsive type need for stimulation, and I feel like I can totally see that connection with self harming.

My question for those of you who may have experience with both ADHD and self harm is this: Should we focus on treating the ADHD first?

1ia9maj,"I'm so goddamned tired of life. TW: suicide talk, brief self-harming talk",MentalHealthSupport,1737881020.0,6,5,"Diagnoses include chronic insomnia for which I've been eating meds since 2009. Long-term, severe generalized anxiety. After I saw the hearse outside my best friend's door and knew he'd killed himself(in 2019) I developed an extreme sensitivity to situational stress that plagues me to this day. Also BPD and Depressive PD diagnosed as co-morbid, which makes everything oh so jolly and life in general just such a breeze.

Due to said diagnoses and some really nullifying experiences: Never had a long-term job, never had a long-term GF as a M(37). Mostly because I always felt 'outside,' invisible, an alien trying to figure out how in the hell did everyone else start pairing up in their teens/late teens.

How is it possible to land or hold a job when I literally think of dying or suicide sometimes even before I shamble into the bathroom in the morning. Today I noticed I was thinking of it only after I realized the thought ""What should my last messages be"" popped into my head. I've been thinking of self-harming with a branding iron again. The searing pain is one of the few things that takes me out of where I have been rotting for so long.

I can't approach any woman anymore, as it would require me to be dishonest about my past and current struggles not to mention my diagnoses. I've already tried enough times and been burned or ghosted right off the top at the merest whiff of my issues, no matter how gingerly I try to start shedding light on them. Always after being asked about something related when it comes to new people, I don't overshare in that sense. I constantly feel like I am less than the shit I scrape from my bootheel. The last semblance of a hobby, singing(, I used to be quite adept) I try to keep up with feels like just going through the motions and I only sing 1-3 songs anymore when I do. The vocal warm-ups take longer than the singing itself, literally.

I am in a treatment program, I am medicated, I am in a peer support group. The intensive program and peer group stop around mid-March though, and I am terrified I'll just slip into my own pattern of cutting and numbing myself with extraneous substances then.  The healthcare here is shambolic and imbalanced at best, so I can't trust any healthcare provider's promise of ""You won't be left alone with your problems"" anymore. I have been pushed aside and made to feel invisible by them too, many, many times.

Why can't I just make myself an inch-thick tie... I am so tired. I'm tired of living just so my parents and the few friends I have wouldn't feel bad. I live in mental destitution and time has become a prison. Just so others wouldn't feel bad. What about me.. Why do I have to feel bad? Why do I have to feel like I am unworthy of intimacy and love? Why can't I stop so I wouldn't constantly feel less than everything. I want it to stop.",self harm
1jc4v9r,"How can I support my roommate (tw: self harm, addiction)",MentalHealthSupport,1742071913.0,0,1,"I (27f) have lived with my roommate (28f) for a year now. We grew up together and our families are close, and we reconnected about a year and a half ago as adults. We moved about 4 hours away from our hometown and are living together in a big city. My roommate has had a tough year - although she is excelling at work there is a lot of drama and she isn't using her masters degree in the way she wants, she's struggled with eating and body image, and she's gone on some really awful dates (like truly terrible) and hasn't had the best of luck dating. On her 28th birthday she broke down because she has never been in a relationship.

It's been tough to watch her struggle with her mental health the last year. I try to be supportive by hearing her out, letting her vent, validating her, and trying to build her up. I plan activities I think she'll like so she is getting out and exploring. I've also suggested she try therapy. She's been in therapy before and liked it. I go to therapy weekly and think it is so beneficial and sent her the website where I found my therapist, although she hasn't signed up yet. 

She is also sober due to an addiction in college and I think she's struggled not to relapse. I've had to stop her from driving to the liquor store a few times. She often starts vaping then tries to quit cold turkey which causes really bad panic attacks, one so bad she almost went to the ER. She's struggled with rejection from jobs and men and that can cause a big emotional reaction. 

The weather is starting to warm up and yesterday she was in short sleeves - I noticed she had cuts up her arm. She's struggled with self harm in the past. I think my means of supporting her aren't enough and I was hoping I could get advice on this situation and supporting her better. Should I sit her down and address the cuts and her mental health in general? Do I get her parents involved? She is very close with them and they stepped in during her addiction. I know when she struggles she calls them. 

I am very worried about her and think she probably needs professional help. What can I do?",self harm

So, as in the title, I'm having a crisis right now. I guess I just need to let it out and for someone to listen... Or read in your case. 

So, I was always mentally unstable, very prone to crying quickly from a young age until I became 13 and depressed. I went to therapy from then until I was 16. When Covid hit I suddenly felt better for some reason. Then after a few weeks of lock down in my country, I got worse again, but didn't think I needed to call back. Then I got better. Then worse. Then better. 
I never tracked how long or what the reasons could be, but I just have good weeks, bad weeks and neutral weeks. Not that I feel neither good or bad in neutral weeks... It's both, but just way less intense. Or it's absolutely nothing. 
I have phases where I don't feel anything or everything all at once. Months where I constantly have to actively remind myself that I exist. That I'm not just a spectator or in a dream. That things and people around me are real and that I have real impact and real concequences. Even that I'm writing this post and people will see it and form their opinion based on this. 

So naturally, I started to cut one day. I think the first time I did it at 14. Then didn't really stop much. Until about 400 days ago (I got an app that tracks the days, but I can't be brought to look up the exact number now). I'm now 20. Going on 21 in the summer. If I live until then. And now I'm struggling to not relapse.

I live in Germany where driving lessons are mandatory if you want a driver's license. I didn't think I wanted one until I stopped going to Uni after only one semester because I couldn't handle taking the train back and forth every day, for 2 hours, not having people there and not feeling real. So I started looking for work, one year ago. I almost have a job, but I can't share the details. And I'm aware that the people there have my social media and could theoretically see this, but that's not as important right now. But you can probably get the idea that I'm really stressed and anxious. 
Anyway. I noticed that I hate driving. But I already spent so much money on the lessons and my driving exam is soon, so I can't really stop now. I always cry during my driving lessons. Not because I feel so comfortable with my instructor but because I can't stand his comments. I can take criticism... But not his. And today, I snapped. Told him to ""Shut the f up!"" and that I couldn't stand anything anymore. That every lesson I want to drive into a tree or get out in the middle of the lesson. And while driving home I apologized, but still felt bad. I can't vent to him, but the dam inside me broke. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Now I'm home. And everything feels wrong. I'm not sad but still crying. Or maybe I am sad and just don't feel it. I'm definitely upset, but I don't know if it's anger, sadness, frustration or anything of the usual. Maybe it's just catharsis. 

I'm home alone. Still live with my mom and younger brother, but because I'm currently unemployed and my mother isn't and my brother still goes to school, I'm alone often. Practically the whole day until they return home around evening. And then, after work or school respectively, the often go to do other things. My brother hangs out with his girlfriend of a few weeks. Or they go to their volunteer work at the Red Cross (idk what else to call it). My mother hangs out with friends and my brother also does Judo lessons. So I'm pretty much alone at home all the time, except for at night. 
Alone with my thoughts, wallowing in my own self-pity. Some of you can probably relate to that feeling. I mean I have hobbies. I'm writing a fantasy book on the side, watch videos and play games. Sometimes I draw. Sometimes I just lay there listening to music ‚Äì to other people voicing what I can't explain. 
And it's not that I don't have friends either, but they all moved away. I live on the countryside, they live in big cities. Far away, going to Uni. They moved on and I got left behind. 

So naturally, I have severe impostor syndrome if I may self-diagnose. I feel like a failure. A burden to my family. Like I will never achieve anything or 'catch up' with my friends. And I don't have anyone to talk to. And even if I did, I probably wouldn't talk to them about it because I don't want to be a burden. Or a nuisance. And because most of them don't get me. Or what's wrong with me. And sometimes when they try to help it feels like they're suffocating me. It's often way too much. 

Everything is too much and I don't know what to do! I'm on the edge, about to fall over without a rope or someone to catch me. And I hate it. I don't want to cut again, because I don't want to let anyone, especially my family down. And I don't want to ""end things"" because I'm just about to get my life back, right? I can't give up right now? No matter how tempting it is. But nobody can talk me down... 

I don't know what to do with myself. How to save myself if that's even possible. I can't go to therapy because our awful German health system (even though it's way better than in the US) has two classes. Rich people and average people. Private Healthcare and state Healthcare. I can't afford therapy and finding a therapist who takes state Healthcare on the countryside is next to impossible. It's easier to find a unicorn to get an appointment in time. And I'll probably move away in August anyway, so after 3 months of waiting I'll only have about 3 months. It's not worth it. 

So I'm all alone with my struggles. No friends around. No partner because who would even want this mess? My family is always away... Only cats to provide company if they aren't currently taking my last nerve from me... 

And even writing all of this out doesn't help me, like venting somewhere (usually a diary or a WhatsApp story) usually does. I don't know what's wrong with me or how to fix it. And I know you probably don't know either or you wouldn't be here. Just know if you're going through something similar, you're not alone. And if you do, maybe tell me... So I know I'm not alone either!

I guess hair, sometimes but mostly eyes.. eyes are just so fucking beautiful.. but I wish the rest of me was too.. I wish I wasn't so fat.. I wish my smile wasn't weird, I wish my neck wasn't so weird, I wish I was more fit, in the exercise kind of way and stuff. I just.. wish I was perfect.. I wish I was pretty.

Sometimes I wish my neck would bruise or whatever when I.. do that.. but nothing shows up.. ever.. but maybe that's a good thing.. it means my family wouldn't question.. but it also means I'm weak.

Sometimes I wish bad things would happen to me and sure some bad things do but.. I mean really bad things.. but.. I know I shouldn't wish that and as much as I do wish it in also fucking scared of it happening to me.. I guess I just want a fucking reason to be the way I am but.. I have none.. I'm just this way because I am.. everyone hates me because they hate me..

I'm an attention seeker, manipulater, controller, abuser, freak, loner.. I'm a fucking nobody.. I don't understand why anyone would like me.. or are they just lying and using me because they know its fucking easy.. because I'm an easy target, I'm naive, stupid, young, lonely.. just a fucking full on fucking fuck up nobody..

1i97pdb,Can someone please clarify what actually qualifies as cutting and self harm?,MentalHealthSupport,1737757184.0,0,1,"Just what it says on the tin. I confessed to my mom that I had cut myself a few weeks ago and  she said what I had done wasn‚Äôt actually ‚Äúcutting‚Äù.

Basically what happened was that I had gotten in trouble for one thing or another and had cut up my thigh and shoulder out of frustration. None of the cuts were deep, just a lot of shallow cuts. This only happened two or three times, and it wasn‚Äôt over anything really serious. Just stuff like sleeping through my alarm and missing school. 

My mom told me that actual cutters think about cutting all the time and don‚Äôt let the pain stop them, and what I was doing was just a poor coping mechanism. I‚Äôm autistic (it‚Äôs not super noticeable or severe tho) and I know that self harm is a way to cope with overstimulation and overwhelming emotions sometimes. I do genuinely struggle with mental illness and self loathing but idk. I felt really stupid and like I had taken things too literally, which I do a lot. I was also really frustrated bc if I knew that it wasn‚Äôt actually that bad I could have worked on it with my therapist.

1i45feu,How can I (22f) support my sister (16f) as she struggles with self harm?,MentalHealthSupport,1737198816.0,0,1,"If you struggled with self harm and had an older sister, what would you want her to say or do? What would help? Please tell me, I am so lost.

A little backstory: we both grew up with a mother that has narcissistic traits (we still live with her right now), our father passed away in 2016. We both have had mental health problems. When I was 18, I was suicidal and ended up spending 2 weeks at a mental hospital where I got help, I'm better now, though still dealing with anxiety and depressive episodes to this day.

My sister has gotten depressed these past couple years as well. A couple factors that contributed to her state: she‚Äôs now attending a highly competitive high school known for tough math and physics (they have daily tests, long hours, and intense academic pressure); she has had troubles in romantic relationships; and of course, we still live with our mom, so there is that.

She started doing self-harm around that time.¬†**She is getting professional help.**¬†Every time mom notices the cuts, she yells at her (""you're getting help, why is nothing changing, am I spending all this money on nothing? Stop it, promise me you will never do it again""). I defended my sister multiple times, I stood between them telling mom to leave her be, to be supportive, can't you see she's struggling? She would not shut up and go away or listen, it's insane, she can spend hours just complaining about this until my sister starts to shake and cry uncontrollably, after which she starts going on a ""look, you're literally crazy"" tangent. One day my sister slept in my room while I was guarding the door, so that mom doesn't come in.

Overview of the current situation:

\- My sister developed sort of a defence strategy: any time mom talks to her now (any topic, even if it's normal conversation), she rudely tells her to leave, shut up, etc.

\- She can talk to me normally

\- She takes meds, only when reminded many times, otherwise she skips them

\- She has appointments with the mental health doctor every couple weeks

\- She can't go in a hospital like I did, this help is only available if you are 18+ here

\- She keeps cutting herself fairly often, I don't think there has been progress in over half a year of therapy, although I'm not expecting her to heal instantly, I'm just worried

\- She also takes pictures of it

\- Her boyfriend is trying to help her not self harm, but she is either passive agressive with him or apologising profusely? (I don't know what's going on here, I may be lacking context)

\- One day I asked her to do a chore, she snapped and said ""say thank you that I'm still alive"", from what I know she told her boyfriend she felt like one day she would kill herself. So that is something that is on her mind

\- Whenever anyone says any tiny thing that she doesn't want to hear (usually asking to do basic chores like turning off the lights when leaving the house, brushing the toilet after number 2, putting her clothes away) she ignores her way out of it or says ""yes of course"" and never does it, which is the same thing. I get that these things are hard when you are struggling with mental health though.

\- Sometimes she comes home late (11pm+), turns off her location on Life360, ignores calls and messages. Tells us afterwards she didn't hear it and was with her friends

\- In general, I try talking to her every day, not about the self harm but just asking what's new, telling her she can talk to me if there is anything, giving her my stuff/money if she needs any, etc. She only shares very basic information (i.e. ""had a test today""), I don't want to pressure her into talking about anything she's not comfortable talking about, because I'm worried that might push her away. Out of personal things, she only once shared that her boyfriend cheated on her, and I told her that she deserves better, she deserves to be with someone who respects and cares about her (they are back together now, now all she says about him is how good of a person he is).

I don't know. I'm trying to be supportive, but I feel like there is no connection between us. I have struggled with depression too, but self harmed only once before. So, as a concept, self-harm is foreign to me, I feel like I don't understand it completely. I don't understand my sister, I want to help though. I don't know what I might be doing wrong. Things are mostly awkward between us. We talk, but surface-level. I can feel she doesn't hate me, but that's about it. She keeps pushing everyone away.

For context, I‚Äôm a high school senior but I don‚Äôt live at home, I live in a residential school. Generally, the dorms are two rooms connected with a bathroom, and for the past couple of months, I‚Äôve been cutting my thighs right before I go into the shower. No one has walked in on me doing this to myself, as I leave the shower running the entire time I‚Äôm doing this (it‚Äôs worked for the past three years but I originally did so to make sure my roommates didn‚Äôt walk in on me changing, but that‚Äôs the least of my worries now).

This weekend, my roommate and suite mates left, leaving me in the dorm by myself. I already wasn‚Äôt feeling good due to yesterday, as I was forced into hosting a two-hour-long event that ended with me being overstimulated for the rest of the day and left me with a nasty headache this morning. 


But to cut a long story short, some information about a dear friend of mine was given to me later in the day, after I self-isolated hours prior. All I‚Äôm going to see they ended up going to the hospital and I had a chance to help them earlier in the day, but they‚Äôre alright now. But this led me to me knee knee-deep in my self-deprecating thoughts up until I made the decision to hop into the shower, and later cut myself.

I didn‚Äôt mean for there to be so many cuts. It just kinda happened. I don‚Äôt entirely remember what happened. I remember having a paper towel entirely soaked in my blood. I remember sitting in the shower, but at some point, I was sitting on the shower rug and then I was in the shower again, being dosed in cold water. 

I think I was having a disassociation episode, but I‚Äôm not sure. It‚Äôs not always like this, generally, it‚Äôs more sudden, normally when I‚Äôm talking with another person or about to take a test. The only other time I‚Äôve gotten like this was when I was given the news of the death of an old friend of mine, but that was closer to a depressive episode than anything else, and in the end, I changed for the better after (along with me not cutting myself regularly at the time).

But the only thing I can remember thinking during all of this was that I wanted, no, needed to cut myself again. To go deeper. For it to have blood spilling on the floor.

I'm not sure what to do. 
There are mental health counselors on campus, I could go to them, but I don't want to waste their time, not when kids are doing worse than I am (and that's not an exaggeration, there was a kid who was battling a really bad eating disorder at the beginning of the year and one of the mental health counselors had to come to campus after hours to help, and there are plenty more kids suffering similarly to her here).

I also don't want to be sent to a ward either. I can't miss out on schoolwork. Most of my schoolwork is art-related and if I can't make art then what else am I good for? Everyone here is upper-dupped smart and then there's me with average test scores and am only halfway even decent at art.

I know going to Reddit for all of this probably wasn't the best or smartest thing, but I didn't know what else to do. ",cutting myself

After I had accidentally cut myself, I decided to take the knife that had already cut me and deepen the wound. I‚Äôm not sure why I did this, but it was like I couldn‚Äôt control my actions or thoughts in the moment. Should I tell my husband about this? He thinks I‚Äôve been doing better and I have, but there are moments or days when things are rough and I have these thoughts and sometimes I act on them. I can‚Äôt control when or how these scenarios are going to happen, so it worries me that it will get worse the next time. I don‚Äôt actually want to hurt myself, but my mental health issues take control of my brain, like I‚Äôm not behind the wheel anymore. What should I do in this situation?

1jl97ys,"Please, what brings you joy?",MentalHealthSupport,1743095888.0,5,4,"TW: Depression/ Suicidal Ideation

I don‚Äôt know how to start this, so I‚Äôll cut to the chase. I‚Äôve been struggling with major depression for over 5 years. I feel little identity within myself, and I find that I struggle to make any decisions regarding my own happiness.

I only do things when other people need me to do them. I feel no drive to do anything out of my own volition because, simply put, I don‚Äôt know what I want. I used to love drawing, anime, singing, listening to music, hanging out with animals, etc. But now, every time I look at those things, I feel no more interest in them. 

I‚Äôve been struggling with this on and off for over five years, and almost any direct call to my family asking for help has been met with distain. While some family members were initially supportive, later becoming burnt out and unresponsive (which I think is fair, because I would probably feel the same way) others like my dad and uncle claim that I am either ‚Äúdoing it for attention‚Äù or that the depression in question no longer exists. My father even went as far to call my antidepressant ‚Äúpoison‚Äù. The thing that hurts the most has been hearing from my closest friends, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt know how to help‚Äù.

I feel absolutely at a loss for what to do. I feel like I‚Äôve done what I‚Äôm supposed to. I‚Äôve talked to my family and friends about it, I‚Äôve sought treatment, and I‚Äôve tried about four different medications to help alleviate symptoms. I was even hospitalized as a result of this suicidal ideation. 

Please, even if it‚Äôs just little things, what helps you get by? How do you feel motivation? Why is it even worth getting out of bed? I figure that if I just start off with the little things, maybe I can pick myself up.

1jkwenj,"Is there any coming back from untreated long-term psychosis, and if so, how to help someone who doesn't want it?",MentalHealthSupport,1743051706.0,2,3,"I'll try to keep this as short as I can, but I want to make sure to give enough context. My brother (43M) was diagnosed with biopolar disorder in his late teens, and after a very rough several years, he really improved in his late 20s and had been largely stable without medication. He and I live several states away, but we've kept in regular contact, especially the last 3 years.

About 22 months ago (summer 2023), he experienced a traumatic event that I now believe may have triggered the beginning of psychosis. He started talking about very dark and concerning things he ""remembered"" from childhood that at the time I couldn't say with certainty were false, but seemed very unlikely to be true. I may have interrupted an attempt at him taking his own life a few weeks after. A few months after that (Oct 2023) he and I did a long camping trip together and had a very nice time, and he had seemed to be back to normal.

Last summer (June 2024) there was another triggering event that made him lash out at my father and cut off communication, which was very sad, but it wasn't the first time he'd gone no-contact because they have a difficult relationship. I've had to be careful since then to avoid the topic because my brother was very angry and blames my dad for difficulties in his own life (which is partially true).

Over the last several weeks, he's been under increasing amounts of stress due to his job contract nearing an end and not having any success finding another opportunity. He believes it's because of my dad that he will lose his job and hasn't been able to find another one (required background checks and some legal trouble my dad got into a long time ago, but my brother has had his own legal troubles as well). He is the sole breadwinner because his partner does not currently work (although he could), and they have a large number of pets to care for. 

A few days ago, we were texting back and forth about lighthearted things and he seemed okay until the conversation started to veer into negative territory. I made a clumsy attempt at changing the subject, and in doing so managed to deeply offend him when saying something that under any normal circumstances would have been easily recognized as a joke. He sent me a picture of a gift I'd gotten him decades prior broken on the floor and told me he didn't know if he wanted to talk to me anymore. I texted his partner to tell him I was concerned about my brother's mental health and asked him to lock up their guns.

The next morning, my brother sent an extremely long email ranting about why he couldn't forgive me and listing out multiple detailed false memories in which myself and both my parents had either emotionally or physically abused him over the years. He referred to himself as an orphan and said he wanted nothing to do with us anymore. I again texted his partner to express grave concern, asked him to look after my brother, and let him know that he can reach out to me if he needs anything. I emailed my brother to apologize for offending him, to explain that I never meant to give the impression I had, and to tell him that I loved him no matter what, but would respect if he needed to take a break. (I did not attempt to refute the false memories because I knew it would not be well-received.)

I messaged my mom to let her know what was going on and suggested she try and continue casually texting with him, but to be prepared in case he decided to push her away as well. To both our surprise, he has continued to respond to her as though nothing is wrong, which gave me hope. But last night, he responded to my email by re-iterating how awful our family is and saying that he would only consider speaking to me again if he managed to keep his job. If his job contract ends with no prospects, he is planning on ending things and had instructed his partner to send prepared letters to each of myself and my parents only after his funeral had passed.

I don't know what to do. Part of me thinks he's so far gone that there's nothing to be done except wait for that awful letter in the mail, and part of me thinks I'm giving up too easily and I need to try and fight to change his mind. But what would I even say? He has no idea that he's so unwell, and seems to believe I'm one of his many tormentors. His partner is timid and passive, and I can't rely on him to intervene. I can't force him to see a psychiatrist or take medication, and would it even help after going untreated for so long? I love him dearly, but I can't see any path that doesn't end with either that letter or a text from his partner confirming the worst. :'(",cutting myself

Until I met my girlfriend and then they told me I wasn‚Äôt a tool. I wasn‚Äôt something someone should use. They helped me for a while and now it just feels like I‚Äôm a tool for their use.
